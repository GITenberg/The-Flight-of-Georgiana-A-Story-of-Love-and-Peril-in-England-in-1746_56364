</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>A little</span> before noon one gray day in September,
1746, a well-made young fellow, in appearance and
fact a gentleman’s servant, rode up the High Street
of a town in the North of England, and through the
passageway of an inn to the yard. Having entrusted
his sorrel nag to an ostler, he hastened to the kitchen,
and proceeded to give orders to the landlady with
an absence of deference which plainly showed that
he spoke not for himself but for his master.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are still a few English inns not unlike those
of that time. This particular house was of dull
red brick, its main part extending along the street
and pierced in the middle by the passageway which
led back to the yard. In the front, the ground floor
had four wide windows, and these were matched by
four above, while a fifth was over the passage entrance.
The small panes and stone facings of the
windows gave the inn that look of comfort so characteristic
of eighteenth-century houses, and this
was increased by the small dormer casements in
the sloping roof. The passage itself, paved with
stones worn comparatively smooth, was capacious
enough to admit a stage-coach or a carrier’s covered
wagon. As you entered it, you saw the yard beyond,
which was bounded by a wing of the main
building and by stables, sheds, and sundry out-houses.
Half-way through this passage, you found
at your left hand a door, which opened to a public
parlour, wherein meals were served at a common
table to stage-coach passengers and other outside
guests. At the right-hand side of the passage was
a wider doorway, giving access to a small entry,
from which you might step forward into the kitchen,
or rightward into the bar, or leftward to a narrow
stairway that wound steeply to the floor above.</p>

<p class='c012'>The kitchen was not the least attractive of these
destinations,—with the ample fire in its spacious
chimney-place, the shine of the pots and pans on its
wall, the blackened beams across its low ceiling, its
table devoted to culinary business, its greater table
devoted to gastronomic business—for all guests
of low station, including the servants of those of
higher station, ate in the kitchen,—and the oaken
settles and joint-stools so tempting to the tired,
hungry, and thirsty traveller who might appear in
the doorway.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And lookye, ma’am, you’ll oblige by making
haste,” said the gentleman’s servant, having communicated
his orders, “for master is following so
close he may be here in a quarter of an hour. I’ll
eat my bite while he’s on the way; for he’ll be
having me wait on him at table, and as soon as he’s
finished his dinner we shall be off again,—there’s
eight bad miles between here and home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He went to that end of the long table whereon
certain cold viands stood exposed, while the landlady
set the cook and scullery-maid upon preparations
for the meal that had been ordered. She
then called a chambermaid and bade her get the
Rose—the best room in the house—ready for the
meal to be served in. By this time the gentleman’s
servant had helped himself to a good slice from the
round of cold beef, and a plentiful supply of bread,
had obtained a pot of beer from the tapster, and was
seated in great comfort at the table. The landlady,
a fat and tyrannical-looking creature, turned to
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When your master stopped here t’other day, on
his way to the South,” said she, “he had nobody
with him but you. But now that he’s coming home,
he orders dinner for two in a private room, and for
one in the kitchen besides yourself. How comes
that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because he’s bringing home the young mistress
and her waiting-woman.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Young mistress, d’ye say? What, then, has Mr.
Foxwell been married? Is that what he went South
for?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, God forbid! No, ma’am, ’tis his niece,
Miss Foxwell, he’s fetching home. She’s been
reared by an aunt on her mother’s side, but now her
education is finished, and, according to her grandfather’s
will, she comes home to Foxwell Court.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then Foxwell Court was left to her? It seems
to me I did hear summat of that estate going to
a gran’daughter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Twas left to master and her together in some
way or other—my master being the younger son,
d’ye see, and she being the orphan of the elder.
They do say master would ’a’ got the most of the
property but for the wicked life he led in London,—I’ve
heard he was a terrible gay man afore he came
to the country to live,—but I wasn’t with him in
them days, so can’t speak from my own knowledge.”
The youth uttered an unconscious sigh, doubtless of
regret at possibilities he had missed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, from what I’ve heard now and again
of goings on at Foxwell Court since your master
came to live there,” said the landlady, “he didn’t
leave all his gay ways behind him in London; but
maybe report is a liar, as the saying is, Master
Caleb.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no doubt there’s summat of drinking, when
the master can get anybody to his mind to drink
with—for, between us, Mrs. Betteridge, he doesn’t
run well with the county gentlemen—as how should
he, with his town breeding? And I don’t say there
isn’t considerable gaming, and frolics with the fair
sex; but the place has been bachelor’s hall, d’ye
see,—till now the young mistress comes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now I dare say all those fine doings will
have to stop,” said Mrs. Betteridge; “—the frolics
with the fair seck, at least.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’ll be a pity,” said a voice behind her,
whereupon the landlady, turning indignantly, beheld
the stout form and complacent ruddy visage of her
husband.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A pity!” she echoed, in wrath and contempt.
“’Tis like you to say it, Betteridge! I hope the
young lady will keep Foxwell Court clean of the
trollops. You’d be up to the same tricks in your
own house if all the maids didn’t scorn you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The landlord’s only reply being a placid puff of
smoke from his long-stemmed pipe, his helpmate
discharged an ejaculation of disgust and waddled
away. He took her place as catechist of the serving-man,
seating himself on the opposite bench.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What news on the road, Caleb?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing to make a song of, as the saying is.
Except at York,—we stayed the night there.
They’ve indicted a great parcel of rebels—seventy-five
all told, I hear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They did better than that in Carlisle last month,—found
true bills against a hundred and nineteen.
Their trials will be coming on soon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, before the trials at York, no doubt. Well,
all I can say is, ’tis bad weather for Scotchmen.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So many of ’em have come over the border to
make their fortunes, ’tis only fair some of ’em should
come over to be hanged. Well, he laughs best that
laughs last. To think what a fright their army
gave us last year,—some of us, that is,—not me.
Have you heard if the Pretender has been caught
yet?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not I. Some think he’ll never be caught,—that
he’s been picked up by a vessel on the Scotch
coast and got safe away for France.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A good riddance, then, say I. I don’t begrudge
him his neck, seeing there’s no fear he’ll ever
ockipy the English throne. The British Constitution
is safe. Well, ’tis all over with the Jacobites;
no more ‘Charlie over the Water’; they’ll have to
make up their minds to drink to King George for
good and all. ’Twill be a bitter pill to swallow, for
some I could mention.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You can’t say that of us. My master has always
been Hanoverian.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, ay, being town bred, and a gentleman of
fashion. ’Tis some of our country gentry I’m thinking
of. Well, they are singing small at present.
Lucky for them they didn’t rise and join the Pretender
when he invaded us last year.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There were mighty few English in his army,
that’s certain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mighty few. A parcel enlisted at Manchester.
And, to be sure, there was the garrison at Carlisle
that declared for him. And some had gone to Scotland
before that to meet him,—madmen, I call
them. But he had no English of any family, barring
a few that came with him from France, I hear:—chips
of the old block, they were, dyed-in-the-wool
Jacobites, from the old breed, that lived abroad for
their health, eh? Well, ’tis all over now—all over
now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Betteridge looked gratified as he said it, but
there was a suppressed sigh beneath his content.
Had he, too, in his day, sometimes held his glass
over a bowl of water in drinking the king’s health?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Except the hangings and beheadings,” he added,
as an afterthought.</p>

<p class='c012'>Caleb made no reply, being busy with his food
lest his master might arrive before he had satisfied
his hunger. The post-chaise which bore that gentleman
was now approaching the town from the
South, under the guidance of a despondent-looking
postilion. Within the chaise, beside the gentleman,
sat a young lady, and on the seat improvised on the
bar in front was a lady’s maid. Between the young
lady and the gentleman, who was middle-aged,
silence prevailed. They did not look at each other;
and something in the air of both seemed to denote
a lack of mutual sympathy.</p>

<p class='c012'>When we describe the gentleman as middle-aged,
we mean as ages went in the reign of George II.,
for it is a vulgar error to suppose that people generally
lived as long in the “good” old days as they
do now. Not to speak of the wars and the hangman,
there were bad sanitation and medical ignorance
to shorten the careers of a vast number, and “drink
and the devil did for the rest.” This gentleman in
the post-chaise, then, was not over forty. Drink and
the devil had made good headway upon him: one
could see that in his face, which was otherwise a
face of good breeding, wit, and accomplishment;
a handsome face, lighted by keen, gray eyes, but
marred by the traces of riotous living and cynical
thoughts, and by a rooted discontent. He was tall
and gracefully formed. His dress betokened fallen
fortunes. The worn velvet of his coat and breeches
was faded from a deep colour resembling that of
the wine he had too much indulged in. The embroidery
of his satin waistcoat, the lace of his three-cornered
hat, the buckles of his shoes, the handle of
his sword, and the mounting of his pistols, were of
silver, but badly tarnished. His white silk stockings
were mended in more places than one; his linen,
however, was immaculate. He wore his own hair,
tied behind with a ribbon.</p>

<p class='c012'>The young lady beside him was very young,
indeed; and very pretty, indeed, having wide-open
blue eyes, a delicately coloured face, a charming
little nose, an equally charming mouth, and a full,
shapely chin. Her look was at once sweet-tempered
and high-spirited; for the time being, it contained
something of disapproval and rebellion. As for this
young lady’s clothes, the present historian’s admiration
for handsome dress on women is equalled by
his dislike of describing it—or hearing it described—in
detail. Enough to say that her gown of dark
crimson, with its high waist, seemed to belong
by nature to the small, slender, and graceful figure
it encased; and was free from the excess—deplored
by good judges then as now—so dear to overdressed
dowdiness. She had, too, the secret still
lacked by some of her fair countryfolk, of poising
a hat gracefully, thus not to look top-heavy; hers
was a hat of darker shade than her gown, with a
good sweep of brim.</p>

<p class='c012'>As for the maid, on the seat in front, she, too,
was rather a young thing,—slim and tall, with a
wholesome complexion, longish features, and the
artful-artless, variable-vacuous, consequential-conciliating
expression of her tribe. An honest, unlettered,
shallow, not ill-meaning creature; cast
by circumstance for a super’s part in the drama of
life, never to be anything more than an accessory.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the pretty young lady, left to her own
thoughts, of what <i>was</i> she thinking? Did her mind
cling regretfully to the life she had just left?—to
the small, well-ordered home of her widowed old
aunt; the decorous society of the staid cathedral
town in the South, with its regular and deliberate
gaieties, its exceeding regard for “politeness”?
Or did it concern itself with the home for which
she was bound, the country-house she had not seen
since childhood, but which she remembered vaguely
as old and half-ruinous then?—with what manner
of life she was to lead there in the society of this
strange, profligate-seeming uncle, who manifestly
did not like her any more than she could find it in
her heart to like him? Or did she have some vague
intimation of great things about to happen unexpectedly?—of
matters of deep import to her future
life, destined to result from the chance coming
together of certain people at the inn ahead?</p>

<p class='c012'>Probably Miss Georgiana Foxwell had no such
thought; but ’tis a fact that at the very time when
her post-chaise was coming into sight of the church-tower
of this town, other conveyances were bringing
other travellers to the same town, to the great
though unintended influencing of her destiny. To
begin at the top, for that was an age of arbitrary
social distinctions, a private coach, drawn by six
horses and followed by a mounted servant, was
lumbering along slowly from the North. Then from
the East cantered two well-fed horses, bearing, as
anybody could see, their owner and his man servant.
From the North again, but far behind and out of
ken of the coach-and-six, came three post-horses
under saddle, one of the riders being the custodian
and guide. And lastly, somewhere between the
private carriage and the hired horses, but not
within sight of either, a stage-coach ground its way
over the rugged eighteenth-century highway. Of
all the vehicles and horses that raised the dust on
English roads that day, only these—with the post-chaise—concern
us.</p>

<p class='c012'>The first to arrive at the inn, where Caleb had
by this time stayed his stomach and stepped out to
look things over in the yard, were the two well-fed
horses. Their owner, a robust, red-faced, round-headed,
important-looking country gentleman of
about five and thirty, slid off his steed with agility,
and, leaving the animals to the care of his man, was
met at the entry door by the landlady.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Welcome, Squire Thornby!—a welcome to
your Worship! I hope I see your Worship very
well, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He took her obsequiousness as his due, and, with
no more reciprocation than a complacent grunt, he
bade her lay a cloth in the Rose and let his man
Bartholomew bring to that room a round of cold
beef and a quart of her best ale. With his snub-nosed
crimson visage, he looked the part he had
been born to fill in life; and was suitably dressed
for it, too, in his brown wig, green cloth coat, brown
waistcoat and breeches, large riding-boots, and plain,
three-cornered hat.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For I’m in haste to get home,” he added, “where
I’ll pay myself for a cold dinner by a hot supper.
So bestir, Mrs. Betteridge, and don’t keep me waiting.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly, your Worship, sir; by all means,
Squire Thornby.” And she called to a chambermaid,
“Moll, lay a cloth for the Squire in the
Thistle, and be quick—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I said the Rose, Mrs. Betteridge. Didn’t you
hear? Thistle be damned!—I never said Thistle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Rose, Squire? The Thistle is far the
better room—<i>far</i> the better, your Worship.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lea’ me be the judge o’ that, woman. I’ll dine
in the Rose, and there’s an end.” Whereupon he
turned toward the stairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your pardon, Squire,—I wouldn’t offend your
Worship for anything,—but the Rose is bespoke
already for dinner-time, and truly indeed most o’
the quality that stops here prefers the Thistle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I prefer the Rose, and the quality that
stop here may be hanged, rat ’em.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m terrible sorry, your Worship. But all’s
ready in the Rose for t’other party, sir; and the
gentleman as sent orders was most particular about
having the Rose—though for my part I can’t see
why he should want that room when he might ’a’
had the Thistle, and so I thought to myself at the
time, sir; and when I seed your Worship arrive just
now, thinks I to myself, how lucky it is t’other
gentleman bespoke the Rose, because now there’s
the Thistle for his Worship. And sure indeed the
cloth’s laid for t’other party, and their dinner a’most
cooked, and we expect them every minute—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Beaten down by this torrent of speech, the Squire
waved his hand for silence, and said, with surly
resignation: “Oh, well, then, the Thistle. Who is
it has bespoke the Rose, drat ’em?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Foxwell, your Worship, a neighbour of
yours, sir, if I may say so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Squire gave a start, and the cloud on his
brow deepened. “Foxwell!” he echoed. “A neighbour
of mine!—H’m! Yes, there is a gentleman of
that name living in my part of the county.” With a
parenthetic “More’s the pity!” under his breath,
he added, in a kind of dogged, grumbling way,
“What the deuce is he dining here for?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, sir, he’s been to the South to fetch his
niece home to Foxwell Court, and they’re coming in
a po’shay, and stopping here for dinner. He sent
his man Caleb ahead on horseback to order it cooked,
so they shouldn’t be delayed, for they have eight
bad miles yet from here to Foxwell Court.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ecod!” said Squire Thornby, “I have the same
bad miles to Thornby Hall—or five o’ them, at
least,—and I ordered a cold dinner so <i>I</i> shouldn’t be
delayed. But, damn it, now I come to think on’t,
I’ll have something cooked, so I will! I presume my
belly is as much to me as Mr. Foxwell’s is to him.
I don’t see why I should eat cold while he eats
hot. Have you got anything on the fire, Mrs.
Betteridge?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He strode into the kitchen to see for himself,
followed by the landlady.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That chicken is almost done,” said he.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis what Mr. Foxwell ordered, your Worship.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I might ’a’ known it! The leg o’ lamb, too, I
suppose. Everything for Foxwell. Does the man
think nobody else has a soul to save?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The leg o’ lamb isn’t his, sir. ’Tis roasting so
as to be ready against the stage-coach arrives.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I’ll have the best cut o’ that. First come,
first served:—let the stage-coach passengers take
what’s left. A beggarly lot, or they’d have coaches
o’ their own to ride in. And send up a bottle o’ the
best wine you’ve got in the house. I’ll dine as well
as Mr. Foxwell, rat him!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Leaving Mrs. Betteridge to put his orders into
execution, he went out to the passage and called
his man Bartholomew, to whom he communicated
his intentions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very good, your Worship,” said Bartholomew,
in the manner of a servant somewhat privileged.
He was a lean, hardy fellow, of his master’s own
age, with a long, astute-looking countenance. “I
see Mr. Foxwell’s man Caleb in the yard, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, and Mr. Foxwell himself will be here
presently. A sight for sore eyes, eh? If I’d ’a’
known he was coming here, I’d ’a’ stopped at the
Crown. No, damme if I would, neither! I won’t
be kept from going where I choose by any man,
least of all a man I don’t like. What’s Foxwell to
me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s small blame to you for not liking him, sir,
if you’ll pardon my saying it, after the way he
acted about his gamekeeper trespassing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A damned set of poachers he keeps on that
place of his. ’Tis a pity for the county he ever
came into it. The neighbourhood did well enough
without him, I’m sure, all the years he was playing
the rake in London and foreign parts.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It makes me sick, if I may say so,” replied the
faithful servant, “the way I hear some folks sing
his praises for a fine gentleman:—it does, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are some folks who are asses, Bartholomew,”
said the Squire, warmly. “Sing his praises
for a fine jackanapes! Fine gentleman, d’ye say?
How can anybody be a fine gentleman on a beggarly
three hundred a year? Why, don’t you know, don’t
all the county know, ’twas his poverty drove him
down here to his estate to be a plague among us?
Ecod, who are the rest of us, I wonder, solid country
gentlemen of position in the county, to be come over
by this town-bred fop with his Frenchified ways?
Give me a plain, home-bred Englishman, and hang
all these conceited pups that come among us trying
to put us down in talk with their London wit and
foreign manners!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The extraordinary heat manifested by the Squire
during this oration was a warning to his man to
desist from the subject, lest he might himself become
the victim of the wrath it engendered. Moreover,
the outdoor passage of an inn was a rather public
place for such exhibitions, though fortunately there
was at the time no audience.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you wait for dinner in your room, sir?”
suggested Bartholomew, after a moment’s cooling
pause.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, I won’t. Tom Thornby won’t beat a
retreat, neither, for any man! I’ll stay till he comes,
now that I’m here, and if he tries any of his London
airs on me, I’ll give him as good as he sends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bartholomew was too well acquainted with the
obstinacy of this vain, grown-up child, his master,
to oppose; and almost at that moment a post-chaise
turned in from the street, requiring both Thornby
and the man servant to stand close to the wall for
safety.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c007'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>FRIENDS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> landlady came bouncing out, followed by
her husband at a more dignified gait, to receive the
newcomers. Indifferent to their salutations, Mr.
Foxwell stepped quickly from the chaise and offered
his hand to his niece, who scarcely more than
touched it in alighting. Caleb meanwhile ran up to
assist the maid, but was forestalled by Mr. Betteridge,
who performed the office with a stately
gallantry quite flustering to the young woman,
causing her to blush, and her legs, stiff with the constraint
of the journey, to stumble. Miss Foxwell
and the maid followed the landlady immediately to
the entry and up the stairs; but Mr. Foxwell, as he
saw Squire Thornby gazing at him in sullen defiance,
stopped to greet that gentleman in the suavest possible
manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, Mr. Thornby, you here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir,” replied the Squire, in the shortest of
tones, and as if determined to show himself proof
against the other’s urbanity; “attending to my
own business.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“An unusual circumstance, I suppose,” said Foxwell,
pleasantly, “as you think it worth mentioning.
A dull sort of day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I dare say,” was Thornby’s savage reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>Not the least altering his amiable tone or half-smiling
countenance, Foxwell continued: “Smooth
roads—that is to say, for these remote parts.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir,” said Thornby, fiercely, conceiving himself
and his county alike disparaged, “I find these parts
quite good enough for me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, I envy you,” said Foxwell, with a slight
plaintiveness. “I wish from my heart I could say
I find them good enough for me—since I am
doomed to live in them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That anything good enough for Thomas Thornby
could not be good enough for another man was not
a proposition soothing to Thomas Thornby’s soul.
Having no fit retort within present grasp of his
tongue, however, and knowing that even if he had
one, his adversary would find a better one to cap
it with, the Squire contented himself with a fiery
glare and an inward curse. Then saying abruptly
to his servant, “See that my dinner is served the
moment it’s ready, Bartholomew,” he entered the
inn and tramped up the stairs with great weight of
heel.</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell laughed scarce audibly, and followed
with a step as light as the other’s was heavy.
Emerging from the stair-head to a passage that
divided the rear from the front rooms, he went
into one of the latter, where he found the table
set, and his niece and her maid at the window, looking
down at the street. Across the way were a
baker’s shop, a draper’s, a rival inn with gables and
a front of timber and plaster; and so forth. A
butcher’s boy with a tray of meat, a townswoman
with a child by the hand, and two dogs tumbling
over each other, were the moving figures in the
scene—until a clatter of horses and a rumble of
wheels were heard, and then the maid exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lor, mistress, what a handsome coach, to be
sure! And see the man servant on the horse behind.
People of great fashion, I’ll warrant. And
they’re coming to this very inn!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Foxwell watched listlessly till the vehicle—the
private coach already mentioned as approaching
the town from the North—had disappeared
beneath the window from which she looked.</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell had been standing at the empty fireplace,
heedless of what might be seen in the street. He
now spoke, carelessly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You saw the amiable gentleman who stood below,
Georgiana, and who passed this door with so
fairy-like a tread as I came up?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t observe him,” replied Georgiana.
“Somebody passed very noisily.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The same. I thought you might remember him
from the days before you left home. But, to be
sure, you were a child then, and he, too, was
younger. He is one of our neighbours, Squire
Thornby.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I remember the name, but I don’t think I ever
knew the gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you never did, you lost little; and you’ll
count it no great privilege when you do know him,—unless
you have a tenderness for rustical boobies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana making no answer, the maid said to
her in a lowered voice, “Lor, m’lady, your uncle
had needs know <i>you</i> better. <i>I</i> saw the gentleman,
and a ojus-looking man servant he had with him.
I never could abide such bumpkin fellows.” The
waiting-woman came from the town in which her
mistress had received her education; she had been
promoted to her present post from that of housemaid
to Miss Foxwell’s aunt, and naturally she brought
superior notions with her to the North.</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell, wondering why the dinner had not
arrived, went impatiently to the door. Steps were
heard ascending the stairs, accompanied by the
voices of women.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The party from the private coach, being shown
to a room,” whispered the maid to her mistress.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that moment Foxwell, in the doorway, called
out in pleased surprise, “Why, as I live—certainly
it is! Lady Strange, upon my soul!—and Mrs.
Winter! and Rashleigh!—George Rashleigh, or
I’m a saint!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He seized the hand of her whom he called Lady
Strange, and kissed it with a gallant fervour;
treated the other lady in like manner, and then
threw his arms around the gentleman who was third
and last of the newcomers (not counting two servants)
in an embrace such as was the fashion at
the time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, upon my honour, ’tis Bob Foxwell,” said
Lady Strange.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was a fair woman in the thirties, of the
opulent style of beauty, being of good height, and
having a fine head, and a soft expression wherein
good nature mingled with worldly nonchalance.
She was dressed as a fashionable person of the
town would dress for travelling, and her presence
brought to the north country inn something of the
atmosphere of St. James’s. As far as attire and
manner went, this was true of her companions also.
The gentleman, whom Foxwell had saluted as Rashleigh,
was a good-looking man of medium age and
size, retaining in face and carriage the air of youth;
he was the elegant town gentleman, free from Foxwell’s
discontent, easy-going and affable without
apparently caring much for anything in the world.
The second lady, Mrs. Winter, formed a contrast to
Lady Strange: she was slight, though not angular;
her eyes were gray, and her complexion clear, yet
the impression she left was that of a dark beauty;
and she had a cold incisiveness of glance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And your devoted slave as ever, Lady Strange,”
said Foxwell, kissing that lady’s hand again. “But
in heaven’s name, what are you doing in this part
of the world? Come in, that I may see you better.
Come, I am dining in this room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They entered the chamber, regardless of the landlady’s
eagerness to show them to a room for their
own use. Mrs. Betteridge would thereupon have
ushered their man servant and lady’s maid to the
room she had chosen, but these menials refused to
proceed without orders, and so remained outside
Foxwell’s door, laden with small impedimenta of
various sizes and uses, from pistols to scent-bottles.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One never knows who may turn up,” said Rashleigh.
“I was thinking of you only yesterday, Bob,
and wondering if I should ever see you again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what ill wind for <i>you</i>,” asked Foxwell,
“blows this good to me?—for an ill wind it must
be to any civilized person that blows him to these
wilds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have the honour to be escorting these ladies
back to London from Lady Strange’s country-seat
by the Tweed, where they have been for the recovery
of their health.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And our good looks,—tell the truth, Cousin
Rashleigh,” said Lady Strange. “My dear Foxwell,
we have rusticated till we are near dead of
dulness,—is it not so, Isabella?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dead and buried, Diana,” said Mrs. Winter,
in a matter-of-fact tone. “And to think you are
still alive, Foxwell? ’Tis so long since you disappeared
from the town, I swear I had forgot you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cruel Mrs. Winter!” replied Foxwell. “But
’tis not for you to speak of being dead and buried.
You know not what rustication is. You have passed,
I suppose, a month or so out of the world, and
are now going back to it; while I have been a
recluse in this county these two years, and may
be so for the rest of my life. The town, as you
say, has forgot me, and God knows whether I shall
ever return. See what poverty brings one to, and
take warning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The reader is doubtless aware that country-house
life did not occupy in the eighteenth century the
place it does to-day in the routine of the “smart”
world. People of fashion had their town houses
and their country-seats then, of course; but many
such were wont to pursue more exclusively the one
life or the other,—to be town mice who sometimes
went to the country, or country mice who sometimes
came up to town. Those who preferred the gaiety
of the town were more prone to count that time
lost which they had to pass out of it, and to look
down upon those who spent most of their days in
the country. When the town mice left London by
choice, it was to take the waters at Bath, or to make
the “grand tour” of the Continent. Week-end
house-parties had not come in, there were no seaside
resorts, and the rich did not hie themselves in August
to the moors of Scotland. “Beyond Hyde Park
all is desert,” said the fop in the play; and Robert
Foxwell and his friends were so far of <i>Sir Fopling’s</i>
mind; they valued wit, and used “fox-hunter”
as a name of scorn. No wonder, then,
that Foxwell declared himself miserable in his
exile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis for your sins, Bob,” said Lady Strange.
“You were a monstrously wicked man in London,
as I remember.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Betteridge now contrived to insinuate herself
into the notice of Rashleigh, addressing him as
“my lord,” and begging to know the wishes of
himself and their ladyships upon the matter of
dinner and rooms.</p>

<p class='c012'>He turned to Lady Strange. “What say you,
Cousin Di? I suppose we shall be driving on as
soon as we have dined—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You shall dine with me,” broke in Foxwell.
“I’ll not lose sight of your faces. I don’t meet a
civilized being once in an age.—You will set more
places, landlady: my friends will dine here.” Without
waiting for their assent, he motioned the landlady
out to the passage, and there gave further
orders.</p>

<p class='c012'>The attention of the three Londoners now fell
upon the two figures at the window. Miss Foxwell,
quite ignored by her uncle since the arrival of his
friends, had remained where she was, regarding
the newcomers with a side glance in which there was
no great joy at their advent. Now that she saw
their looks directed to her, she turned her face
again toward the street, with a slight blush at the
scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a pretty girl it is at the window,” whispered
Lady Strange to her companions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what is she doing here with Foxwell?”
said Mrs. Winter, eying the young lady critically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The dog!—he is to be envied,” said Rashleigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>Resentfully conscious of the cool gaze upon her,
Miss Foxwell whispered to her maid, “How rudely
those people stare at us!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They must be very great quality,” replied the
maid, reverentially. “Their waiting-gentleman
looks the height of fashion,—but their woman
isn’t no great sights.” Miss Foxwell’s maid had
been quick to inspect the attendants of the travellers,
and the lackey had already put himself on ogling
terms with her, a proceeding which the other maid
regarded superciliously.</p>

<p class='c012'>As soon as Foxwell returned to his friends, Rashleigh
called him to account in an undertone: “I
say, Foxwell, if this county produces such flowers
as that at the window, ’tis not so barren a wilderness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That?” said Foxwell, carelessly. “Oh, that’s
my niece, Miss Foxwell. Come here, Georgiana.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She obeyed without haste, and was introduced.
She was not in the mood to affect for civility’s sake
a cordiality she did not feel, nor was she conciliated
by the easy graciousness of Lady Strange, the sharp,
momentary smile of Mrs. Winter, or the unrestrained
admiration of Mr. Rashleigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are a sweet child,” said Lady Strange,
speaking in a sweet tone herself, “to have such a
naughty uncle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I dare say my uncle is not much worse than
other people,” said Georgiana, coolly, with the
intention, not of defending her relation, but of
being pert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She means you, Cousin Rashleigh,” said Lady
Strange, smiling gaily. “She sees your character in
your face.—But, my dear, you can’t have known
much of your uncle in London. I’ll tell you some
tales!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Instead of carrying out her threat immediately,
however, the lady turned her attention to her maid,
bidding her put down her burdens and go and dine
in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c012'>The man servant and Georgiana’s attendant being
dismissed for a like purpose, Foxwell and Rashleigh,
to give the ladies that brief privacy from
masculine eyes which a toilet-marring journey makes
welcome, went down-stairs and paced the yard till
dinner was ready.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So this is the place of your retreat, Bob,” said
Rashleigh; “or hereabouts, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“An old house and some beggarly acres eight
miles from here. ’Tis my last ditch. Perhaps I
was lucky in having that to fall back into. Fortune
was set upon driving me from the field in London.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you might still have contrived to live there
one way or another. Men do, who have lost their
all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By playing the parasite?—begging of people
whom I scorn?—laughing at great men’s stupid
jests, or enslaving myself to great ladies’ caprices?
Not I. Neither could I play the common rook where
I had once lived the gentleman. Nor had I any
fancy for the debtors’ prison. I might have turned
highwayman, but I am too old and indolent, and
the risk is too great. No; for a gentleman who
had made the figure I had, and who could no more
keep up that figure,—curse the cards and the tables,
the mercenary women and the swindling tradesmen!—there
was nothing but self-banishment to the
ancestral fields.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis a wonder you’ve kept <i>them</i>. I should have
thought, from your habits of old, you’d have converted
the last inch into the ready by this time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are beyond my power to convert. The
estate is mine only in part. I share the possession
with that young person you saw up-stairs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The pretty niece?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell shrugged his shoulders. “She may be
pretty—I really haven’t concerned myself enough
to study her looks. I shall doubtless find her an
intolerable drag upon me. Notwithstanding our
relationship, we are new acquaintances. She is
my brother’s orphan—the only child. She was
born at Foxwell Court, the place of my retirement,
and she spent her childhood there. Both her parents
died when she was very young; my father survived
them a year, and upon his death she was sent to be
reared by her mother’s elder sister. During all this
time,—from before my brother’s marriage till after
this girl left Foxwell Court,—I never came near
the place. Most of the time, indeed, I was abroad,
but even when in England I preferred the South,—and
my father perhaps was not sorry for that, for,
to tell the truth, I had never agreed with him and
my brother, and, as the old gentleman loved his
peace, he could spare my presence. After his death
and the departure of the girl, Foxwell Court was
shut up for a long while,—that is to say, till I
sought refuge there two years ago. My father left
the place to me and my niece, on such terms that it
cannot be divided till she marries, nor my share
sold during my lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You speak of it as a few beggarly acres. Had
he nothing else to leave?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not a farthing. Ours was a family of decayed
fortune. You are wondering how in that case I
contrived to make the appearance I did in town
and on the Continent. By the bounty of my Uncle
Richard—you remember him, of course: the
attorney who made a fortune in speculation. He
looked upon life much as I did, and not with the
puritanical eyes of my father and brother; so he
provided for me while he lived, and left me half
his shares when he died,—to prove, I make no
doubt, that virtue does not always pay best. When
I had melted his shares into pleasure, I resorted, as
you know, to the cards, and the tables in Covent
Gardens, thinking they might repay in my necessity
what I had lost by them in my prosperity. ’Twas
a fool’s hope! For a roof to cover my head, I came
home to Foxwell Court. I have at least enjoyed
liberty there. But now that this niece has finished
her education, and comes home in accordance with
my father’s plans, responsibility begins. I was
never made to play the guardian, George. The
affectionate, solicitous, didactic uncle is no part
for me. And especially to a minx who has been
taught to look upon the frivolities of the gay world
with virtuous horror. We have known each other
but four days, and we hate each other already. She
hadn’t been in my society an hour till I perceived
righteous disapproval written upon her face.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I think you mistake the girl altogether.
From the glimpse I had of her, brief as it was, I
could swear she is no prude. There is, indeed, a
delicacy and sensibility in her face, but nothing the
least sanctimonious. She seems to me a young lady
of spirit, a little annoyed about something. No
doubt you expected to find such a girl as you describe,
and you behaved accordingly: she was quick
to take offence, and now you mistake her natural
resentment for self-righteous rebuke.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know not what my expectations had to do
with the matter, but I can see plainly enough her
dislike. And, damme, George, can you imagine
what a restraint upon my conduct the presence of
a young unmarried female will be?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you have only to get her married off your
hands as soon as may be,” said Rashleigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Her marriage means the division of our estate,
and my share then will not suffice to feed a horse
upon. But I won’t balk at that, for the sake of
freedom, if you’ll find me a man willing to take her
with the little she’ll have.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I grant, gentlemen of any fashion want a good
settlement with their wives, in this age. But consider
her beauty:—that is an item on account of
which I, for one, would vastly abate my demands—if
I were fool enough to marry at all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She wouldn’t have you, fool or no fool. I can
see she will be as fastidious when it comes to mating
as if she had ten thousand a year. I fear this region
will not furnish a man to her liking—I can commend
her good taste in that. So heaven knows
when I may be rid of her! But enough of the
chit: I’m saddled with her, and there’s an end.
You must do something for me, George,—you and
Lady Strange and her friend.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Speaking for myself, I’m entirely at your
service.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must make me a visit at Foxwell Court,—now.
Yes, you must. Your time is your own, I
am sure. It matters not whether you arrive in
town this month or the next. While I have you,
I will hold you. When we have dined, you will
drive on with me, not to London, but to Foxwell
Court. You’ll give me a week—nay, a fortnight,
at least—of civilized company, for humanity’s
sake.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why,” said Rashleigh, “’tis rather a change of
plan—though I see nothing against it, for my
part. If the ladies are willing—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They <i>must</i> be willing,” cried Foxwell. “You
must persuade them:—if naught else will do, you
must be taken ill and be unable to go on to London.
Egad, I’ll poison you all with the bad wine they
keep here, ere I let you escape me!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, let me try persuasion first. I can commend
you to them as a host—I know of old that
you’ll stop at nothing that has promise of amusement
in it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll stop at nothing to amuse them as my guests—you
may warrant that. As for my house, you
will not find it entirely uninhabitable. Some of the
company I have kept there of late, though it would
amuse you well enough, would scarce be acceptable
to my Lady Strange; but fortunately, in view of
my niece’s home-coming, I have issued strict decrees
of banishment,—so we shall find no rustic rake-hells,
drinking parsons, or roaring trollops on the
premises. ’Tis in such company I have found solace
in my exile—and I’ll do them the justice to say,
they are better lovers of wit and real mirth than
the booby fox-chasing, dog-mongering, horse-talking,
punch-guzzling gentry and their simpering,
formal womankind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are beginning to practise self-denial, Bob,—driving
your boon companions away,” said Rashleigh,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As a gentleman I could not do otherwise, of
course. Since Miss must needs come, they must
go. I must learn to seek my amusements, such as
they are, out of the house. But I sha’n’t think of
that, or of anything to come, while you and these
ladies are with me. You see I have set my heart on
having you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They continued in this strain, walking to and fro
between the street end of the passage and the rear
of the inn yard, in which different vehicles were
standing idle, until Caleb appeared with the announcement
that dinner for the whole party was
ready. Ascending, they found the ladies on terms
of cool politeness as between Georgiana and the
other two. During the course of the meal, it could
be seen that Mrs. Winter had incurred the greater
part of that disfavour which the girl evidently disdained
to conceal. Good cause for this could be
found, not only in the steeliness of nature suggested
by the London lady’s voice and look, but by the
great freedom of topic and remark she allowed
herself. Time and again was a hot blush called
to Georgiana’s cheek, and she was fain to fix her
eyes upon her plate in indignation at the disregard of
her modesty. That was an age when many young
ladies were accustomed to liberties of speech from
their elders in their presence—liberties nowadays
incredible. How they contrived to ignore them
while they were necessarily conscious of them, as it
is certain they did, calls for admiration. Nothing
that we know of that most delightful of young
women, Sophia Western, makes us esteem and love
her more than the way in which she endured the
coarse talk of her father, never receiving from it
the slightest taint herself, never seeming to notice
the outrageous portions of it. But it was from
men only, or chiefly, that tender ears were used to
hearing conversation so free. Had she been subjected
to it by one of her own sex, even Sophia
Western would have made the protest of a blush.
Not that Mrs. Winter’s anecdotes and observations
were of the crude plainness of Squire Western’s
language. The lady’s tongue was a rapier, not a
bludgeon, and there would have been little if anything
to reprove in the use she made of it on the
present occasion, had Georgiana been absent or ten
years older. As it was, besides the offence to her
modesty itself, Georgiana felt that she was being
treated with intentional lack of consideration. She
thought the lady guilty of spite as well as license:
she noted, too, and placed to her account against
him, the lack of any protest on her uncle’s part on
behalf of her innocence. He laughed and was
merry, in his easy, fine-gentlemanly way; and the
young lady, in her sense of careless outrage, could
scarce restrain the tears of injury, loneliness, and
revolt.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not till the dinner was nearly over, and a
comfortable disinclination to resume their travels
had been created in his friends, that Foxwell put
his invitation before the ladies. At first they declared
such a visit impossible, but as they could
mention no respect wherein the impossibility lay,
and as Foxwell knew how to mingle flattery with appeals
to their compassion, they soon yielded.</p>

<p class='c012'>Poor Georgiana! It may be imagined how far
she shared the joy of her uncle at the prospect of
playing hostess to these people, though, as he had
called upon her openly to second his invitation, she
had perfunctorily done so. This matter settled,
the rest of the company became merrier, and Georgiana
more miserable, than ever.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, though she knew it not, nor could
have dreamt how deeply it would affect her life, the
stage-coach had arrived and left a passenger; and
the two horsemen from the North, guided by the
postboy, were even now riding into the passage
beneath the room in which she sat.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Squire Thornby</span>, in the next room, had finished
his dinner before the Foxwell party had well begun
theirs. In the state of his temper he had attacked
the roast lamb with a fierceness that made his usual
voracity seem delicate in comparison. But, indeed,
a good appetite had something to do with his gastronomic
energy, for he had ridden that morning
from his own house through this town to an estate
some miles eastward, to look at some hounds that
were to be offered for sale, and it was on his return
that he had stopped at the inn. During his meal
he sometimes gave his feelings vent in speech to the
sympathizing Bartholomew, who remained for part
of the time in attendance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I ever catch that there gamekeeper of his
alone without a gun,” said Bartholomew, “you
shall have your revenge on that score, sir,—if I
may be so bold as to say as much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, rat his gamekeeper!” cried Thornby, petulantly.
“You harp and harp on the gamekeeper!—the
rascal cut you out with a girl, didn’t he? When
it comes to that, what the devil do I mind as to the
poaching business and such like? Neighbourly
quarrels will arise, upon trespass and boundaries and
so forth. No, ’tis none o’ that, for all the trouble
he’s put me to. I’ll tell the truth, Bartholomew,
’tis the smooth way he has of taking me down whenever
we meet,—waving me back to second place,
like,—coming over me with his damned fine airs
and glib speeches. That’s what rubs me the wrong
way. <i>I</i> was the fine gentleman in our neighbourhood
till he came; and now—well, ecod, we shall see, we
shall see!”</p>

<p class='c012'>This, indeed, was the true secret of the squire’s
animosity, as it is of many a bitter hatred. It is
easier for some men to forget a material injury to
their rights or interests than a sentimental hurt to
their vanity, and when they have to expect a repetition
of the latter in some new form at every future
encounter, they must be greater philosophers than
Squire Thornby if they do not rage. Indeed, had
Foxwell’s offence not been partly wilful, his superiority
in mind and manner would alone have drawn
the Squire’s hate. Thornby’s envy was not of the
admiring sort that would emulate the merits of
its object: it was of that churlish kind which, with
no desire to possess those merits for their own sake,
fiercely resents the superiority they imply.</p>

<p class='c012'>His dinner disposed of, he went down-stairs,
treading heavily as he passed his enemy’s door,
which was now closed. Bartholomew had told him
of the company that had arrived, and he could hear
their laughter as he went by. He peered into the
kitchen to see what their servants looked like; and
the magnificence of attire of their coachman, valet,
and waiting-woman did not put him into any better
humour. He then stepped into the yard and viewed
their coach, and finally took notice of their horses
feeding in the stalls. Seeing nothing he could disparage,
he contented himself with a sniff of scorn
at such extravagant fopperies, and betook himself
to the public dining-room to wait while Bartholomew
attended to his own appetite in the kitchen. The
Squire had heard the arrival of the stage-coach some
time before, and he now supposed there might be
a congenial passenger or two with whom to exchange
news.</p>

<p class='c012'>He found a single passenger—a slim, discreet-looking
man of less than medium height, with a
smallish brown face beginning to wrinkle, a sharp
nose and chin, a curious appearance of huddling
himself together so as not to fill much space, and
lead-coloured eyes that lifted their gaze without
haste from their owner’s plate and rested intently
for a moment upon Thornby. The eyes were then
deferentially lowered. The man was decently
dressed in brown and gray, and wore a wig of the
latter colour. The Squire set him down as a tradesman
in comfortable circumstances, or perhaps an
attorney or attorney’s clerk, and a civil sort of
fellow who knew how to drop his glance in the
presence of his betters.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good day, friend,” began the Squire. “You
arrived by the stage-coach from the North, I take
it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir,” replied the other, briefly, but civilly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Travelled far?” pursued Thornby.</p>

<p class='c012'>“From Edinburgh, though not all the way by that
coach. And previous thereto, from Inverness-shire.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re not a Scotchman, though?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no, sir; not me, sir. Not so bad as that.
I was with the Duke’s army in Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, then, you helped to put down the rebellion?”
said the Squire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In my humble capacity, sir. I was waiting-gentleman
to an officer, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>(“A mighty worthy fellow,” thought the Squire,
while the stranger paused in his talk to dispose of
a large mouthful of meat. “He might pass for a
shopkeeper or a quill-driver, yet he owns at once to
being a servant—though for my part, I don’t see
why a gentleman’s valet shouldn’t rank above a
rascal clerk or tradesman any day—he certainly
sees better society.”)</p>

<p class='c012'>“I did my small share of fighting,” continued the
worthy fellow; “was wounded, sir, which is the
reason I’m now going home to London.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He put back one side of his wig, and disclosed
an ear minus a good portion of its rim. Though he
gave no further information on the point, and
showed no sign of deafness, it was to be assumed
that some internal injury had been caused, for it
was difficult to see how the mere mutilation of the
ear, damaging as it was to the man’s appearance,
could be held sufficient reason for his retirement
from service.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your health, sir,” said the man, raising a pot
of ale to his lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thankye,—thankye, my good man,” said the
Squire, approvingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You live in these parts, sir, may I be so bold to
ask?” said the good man, with a deferential mildness,
having swallowed a great part of the contents
of the pot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, certainly. Why d’ye ask?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because in that case you might be able, and so
condescending, to direct me to a person I’m wishing
to pay my respects to,—a gentleman of the
name of Foxwell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Foxwell! What do you want of him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The abruptness of the Squire’s speech, and the
sudden clouding of his brow, would have attracted
anybody’s notice, and were not lost on the man
whose request had caused them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Robert Foxwell, Esquire,” added the man,
quietly, “who came into this county from London
about two years back, is the particular gentleman
I mean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, there’s only one,” replied the Squire,
gloomily, “only one Foxwell in this county now.
He’s the last of the name.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pardon me, sir,” said the other, delicately, “but
if I dared take the liberty, I should judge from your
manner that you’re not a friend of his.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the lord, you’re a good judge!” said
Thornby, without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you very humbly, sir. If I might take
the further liberty of asking whether he’s a man
of—ah—any considerable wealth to speak of,
nowadays—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s as poor as a church mouse, and I’m not
sorry to say it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m rather sorry to hear it,” said the man, looking
gravely into his pot of ale. “Oh, not on his
account, sir: on my own. I’m purely selfish in
my sorrow, sir. The truth is, I had something to
sell him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, friend,” said the Squire, taking a seat
near the table’s end where the traveller was, “if
it’s something of any value that you have to sell,
my advice is to look for another customer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The trouble is,” replied the man, musingly,
“this that I have to sell wouldn’t be of any value
to anybody but Mr. Foxwell—unless to his enemies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The last words were spoken very softly, as if
they represented a meditative afterthought of no
practical utility. The man continued to keep his
eyes lowered from meeting the Squire’s, and a
thoughtful pause ensued.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Enemies? What the devil—?” said the
Squire in his mind. But presently he broke forth
in his blunt manner, “Lookye, my man, you may
speak freely to me if you be so minded. I’m all for
plain-dealing, I am. My name is Thornby,—anybody
can tell you how Thomas Thornby, of Thornby
Hall, Justice of the Peace, stands in this county.
Anybody can tell you whether he’s to be trusted or
not. What’s all this here about Mr. Foxwell and his
enemies? It concerns me, by the lord, for I’m at
least no friend of his, I can tell you that much and
not betray any secrets, neither.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, then, sir,” said the other, his face lighting
up as though a happy idea had that instant
occurred to him, “you might be a better customer
for what I have to sell than Mr. Foxwell himself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the lord, I’m able to pay a better price,” said
the Squire, with frank self-gratulation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know anything of Mr. Foxwell’s history,
sir?” asked the stranger.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know that he was born at Foxwell Court, the
old seat of the family in this country; that he was
sent away to school when young, and then to Oxford,
and after that travelled in foreign parts. Fine
way to bring up an Englishman! When he did
come back to his own country, he thought best to
live in London, and he never darkened his father’s
door in those days: there wasn’t any love lost
between him and his people here in their lifetime,
I’ve heard. Howe’er that be, he wasn’t seen hereabouts,
so I never set eyes on him till he came back
to the Foxwell estate to live, about two years since,
after squandering a fortune his uncle left him—so
the story goes. That’s all the history I know of
him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can vouch for the truth of one part, sir,—as
to squandering his money in town. I had hoped
perhaps his affairs had improved since he retired
from fashionable life.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what of his history? I’ve told you all I
know. What do <i>you</i> know?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Squire leaned forward toward the traveller
with an almost painful expression of eagerness on
his face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, sir,” said the other, as if with some reluctance,
“as you are good enough to take an interest,
I see no reason why I shouldn’t tell you a little
story. I dare say you remember the affair of Lord
Hilby,—him that was murdered by footpads one
night in Covent Garden.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I heard of it at the time,” said the Squire,
“’twas two or three years ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir. His lordship had been playing till a
late hour in a gaming-house, you may remember,
and had won very heavily. He was walking away
from the house, his pockets full of gold. He was
attended by a servant and a linkboy. It was a very
dark night. No doubt, sir, you know the place,—what
they call the piazza in Covent Garden, where
the gaming-houses are.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was there—once,” replied the Squire, with
a glum look: no doubt he had reason to repent the
experience.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, sir, once is enough for many a country
gentleman,” said the other, sympathetically,
“though the tables don’t always have the best of
it. There’s been fortunes retrieved there, as well
as fortunes lost. And certainly Lord Hilby had been
in wonderful luck that night. Some think that
word of his large winnings had been passed out to a
person in the street, in the short time between his
rising from the table and his leaving the house. Of
course everybody in the room knew how great his
winnings were, and saw where he put them. In any
case, there was no chair to be had when he came
out, and he started to walk to Pall Mall. But he
hadn’t gone far when suddenly three ruffians sprang
up from the foot of one of the pillars of the
colonnade, where they had been crouching all in a
heap. One of them knocked the link out of the boy’s
hand, one attacked the servant with a bludgeon, and
the third caught my lord by the throat and called
for his money.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis a wicked, dangerous place, London!”
observed the Squire, in a low voice, shaking his
head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The linkboy ran away, leaving his torch still
burning on the ground. The fellow who had
knocked it now joined him that was grappling with
his lordship. All this the servant saw, and then he
was felled to the earth, where he lay stunned for
a little while. During that time, it must have been,
the footpads struck my lord dead with a bludgeon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thornby gave a shiver of discomfort.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When the servant came to,” the narrator continued,
“he found that the footpads had gone; and
two gentlemen, who had left the same gaming-house
soon after his master, were now examining
him to see if he was alive, by the light of the torch,
which one of them had picked up. They had seen
the scuffle as they were coming from the gaming-house,
and had run up with their swords drawn,
making such a noise that maybe the footpads had
imagined them to be a large party. In any case,
the footpads had taken to their heels. The two
gentlemen informed the servant they believed his
master to be dead. He joined them in a further
examination, and found that his lordship’s money
was gone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, to be sure,” said Thornby. “The rascals
got the money before they ran away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A very natural supposition, sir,—in fact, the
only probable one. The servant came to that at
once, and the world accepted it afterwards,—that
the footpads had succeeded in getting the money
before the two gentlemen arrived. But, sir, do you
know that in this world ’tis just as often that the
probable supposition isn’t the true one?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What d’ye mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, sir, the truth is, as I’m a living man,—and
this is entirely between us for the present, sir,—’tis
a secret I’ve kept for a long time, and if I
didn’t feel I could rely on you as a gentleman with
a particular interest in Mr. Foxwell—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly you can rely on me,—no fears on
that score. But what the deuce has this to do with
Foxwell? Come, out with it, man! I can keep a
secret as well as the best.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, sir, thanking you kindly for your assurance,
the truth is, the footpads <i>hadn’t</i> got the money
before they ran away. At least they hadn’t got all
of it, or so much but that a considerable amount
was left.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How, then, if the servant found it was all
gone?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Simply that those two gentlemen, having suffered
heavy losses that night, being in all likelihood
at their wits’ end for a further supply of the needful,
and finding his lordship’s pockets lined with the
same, had succumbed to the temptation of an instant,
and transferred the shiners from his pockets
to their own while the servant still lay senseless
on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The devil you say?” exclaimed the Squire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A shocking thing, sir, no doubt,—robbery of
the dead. It has a singularly bad sound when put
that way, for some reason or other, has it not?
So <i>ungentlemanly</i> a crime, if I may presume to offer
an opinion, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A devilish risky one, too, I should say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, no, sir, I should think a particularly safe
one on this occasion. The servant and the linkboy
could both testify to the attack by the footpads, and
it would be taken as certain—just as everybody
did take it—that the footpads had succeeded in
their purpose before they fled.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, but the footpads themselves knew they
hadn’t. They had only to come forward and say
as much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But by coming forward to say it, sir, they must
needs have incriminated themselves of the murder.
No, there was little reason to fear that, I
should consider: as a matter of fact, they never did
come forward. Nor I never heard of their even
threatening to do so—in a way of extorting money,
you understand. No, sir, a very safe crime on the
part of the two gentlemen, if I may say so again.
And, lookye, sir, how circumstances alter the appearance
of things. Suppose my lord had lost the
money in the gaming-house that night, and these
two gentlemen had won it, as might very easily have
happened. There would then have been no crime
in their possessing it, no dishonour, no ungentlemanliness;
they would have had no reason for
concealment. But as matters were, if the truth
ever got out, are there any bounds to the horror and
ignominy with which the names of those gentlemen
would be held by the great world they moved in?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if it never got out, then how the devil do
you know it? Answer me that, man?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In a moment, sir. I should have thought you
would be curious as to who these gentlemen were?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, who were they? In course I’m curious.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One of them was a certain baronet, since deceased;
the other, Robert Foxwell, Esquire.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eh!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Robert Foxwell, Esquire,” repeated the stranger.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Thornby’s surprise, as depicted on his
countenance, was as jubilant as if he had received
sudden news of an unexpected bequest. He rose
and snapped his fingers in the air, and seemed with
difficulty to restrain a shout. But after a moment
he sat down again, and eagerly demanded:</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how do you know it?—how do you know
it, man? How are you sure of it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You shall see in a minute, sir. The baronet
had excellent luck with the money he took, and was
able to make as good a figure as ever. But the
adage, sir, in regard to ill-gotten gains, though it
failed in his case, was fulfilled in Mr. Foxwell’s.
There <i>does</i> seem to be a partiality shown in the
workings of Providence sometimes. Mr. Foxwell
had the worst of luck, and soon the bailiffs were
after him. He was taken to a sponging-house, and,
after trying friend after friend in vain, he saw
imprisonment for debt staring him in the face. I
suppose his interest in the family estate hereabouts
was tied up in some way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, he could touch nothing but his share of
the income,” said the Squire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And on that, no doubt, he had already raised
what he could. A mere drop in the bucket, I dare
say. However it be, he was certainly in a desperate
condition. I don’t know whether you’ve ever seen
the inside of a debtors’ prison, sir,—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ecod, man, not me!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only as a matter of curiosity, sir, I meant. But
you’ll take my word for it, I hope, that ’tis really
no place for a gentleman. The fear of it would
drive a man of Mr. Foxwell’s habits, I can well believe,
to desperate measures. Well, sir, what did
he do, when he saw everything failing him, but
write a letter to the baronet—he had written three
before, and got no answer—a letter to the baronet,
from the sponging-house, in which he said that if
the baronet didn’t come to his assistance immediately,
he’d be damned if he wouldn’t confess all
and let the world know who really got Lord Hilby’s
money that night. Yes, sir, in black and white he
wrote those words, which distinctly appear in the
letter,—‘<i>Confess</i> all and let the world know who
got Lord Hilby’s money that night.’ So the baronet
obligingly went to his assistance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And how did all this come to <i>your</i> ears?”
queried the Squire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The baronet threw the letter, as he thought, into
the fire. But he had a faithful servant, who hooked
it out, as a matter of habit, read it in private, and
filed it away for future reference. He didn’t see
any occasion to refer to it, the faithful servant didn’t,
for a long time. Meanwhile, Mr. Foxwell, after
various ups and downs, finally left London; and
the baronet died. The faithful servant became waiting-gentleman
to a king’s officer, and went through
the campaign in Scotland. Being wounded, and
losing his place, he set out to return to London.
He had heard what county Mr. Foxwell had sought
retirement in, and, having to pass through that
county on his way South, he thought it might be
worth while to look the gentleman up and see
whether he attached any value to an interesting
specimen of his earlier handwriting.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you are the baronet’s faithful servant?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, your honour,—Jeremiah Filson, at your
service. And here is the letter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He produced a pocket-book from the breast of his
coat, and brought the document out of a double
wrapper of soft paper. Holding it tightly with
both hands, he placed it within reading distance of
the Squire, having first drawn it back with a polite
“Your pardon, sir,” when the latter made an involuntary
reach for it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“His hand, sure enough,” said the Squire, who
had sufficient reason in the correspondence preceding
their litigation to know his neighbour’s penmanship.
He first examined the signature, “R.
Foxwell,” and then carefully read the note—dashed
off with a scratchy pen and complete disregard
for appearance—from beginning to end.
The sheet was slightly burnt at one side, and had
in all respects the evidence of genuineness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lookye, Jeremiah Filson,” said the Squire at
last, as he eyed the letter covetously, “Foxwell
can’t for his life give you twenty pounds ready
money for that piece of paper. In any case you may
be sure I can outbid him. Don’t you approach him
at all, that’s my advice. ’Twould be time lost, if
you expect to get anything worth while; and,
besides that, he’s a shrewd fellow, is Mr. Foxwell,
and he might bubble you out of the letter before
ever you knew what you were at. You’d best deal
with me, you had. Understand, I wouldn’t make
any harmful use of it, though I do dislike the man.
But I have the fancy to crow over him a little,
d’ye see,—that’s all,—nothing harmful. Now
what—”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this critical moment the pair were interrupted
by Bartholomew looking in and announcing that
the horses were ready. Thornby bade him shut the
door, wait outside, and be damned. The first and
second of these items being complied with, the
Squire entered into negotiations with Mr. Filson
for the possession of the letter. That gentleman,
having carefully put away the document in its
former resting-place, seemed in no hurry to come
to terms. He listened to the Squire with sedate
civility, but was adamant upon the point of a good
round sum in ready money. The end of their talk
was that Filson agreed to call at Thornby Hall the
next day, and not to dispose of the letter in the
meantime. The Squire did not tell the man that Mr.
Foxwell was even then under the same roof with
them. If Filson found this out before Foxwell’s
departure, a meeting might occur, though it was
scarce likely that Foxwell would give opportunity
for it at the inn. In any case, the Squire would have
a chance to outbid his enemy. Having elicited the
further promise that Filson would not at any time
tell Foxwell that he, the Squire, was dealing for the
letter, or knew of its existence, he took his leave.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Filson heard the Squire’s horses clatter
out of the passage, and break into a trot in the
High Street. As the sound died away, he drank the
last of his ale, and indulged in a comfortable smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A mighty fortunate meeting,” he mused. “This
booby will buy the letter at my own price. He
would give his brains, if he had any, for the means
of getting the upper hand of his enemy. And a perfectly
safe man to deal with, too. As for Foxwell,
I could never be sure but he would cut my throat
if I went to him with the letter. Now that difficulty
is removed,—’tis certainly the hand of Providence.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He yawned profoundly, and then resumed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I may find this Justice of the Peace a convenient
friend if I have occasion to tarry in this neighbourhood.
But I’ll get his money for the letter first:
otherwise he might make his friendship a part of
the price. A fool would have gone farther at this
first interview,—but you’re no fool, Jeremiah; no,
sir, a fool is what you certainly are not.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He rang the bell and asked to be shown to a
bedroom, saying he had not slept the previous night.
Being informed by the landlady that a room would
be ready in ten minutes, he strolled out to the yard
to pass the intervening time there. He had taken
a turn or two, when out from the kitchen came a
young woman who seemed to be in a huff. She
was very red in the face, and talked ostensibly to
herself, but really for the benefit of all who might
hear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The conversation of that London maid is truly
scangelous!” quoth she.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eh, my dear,” said Mr. Filson, stopping in front
of her, “has anybody been scandalizing those pretty
ears of yours?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Prudence—for it was Miss Foxwell’s maid—took
note of the stranger with much artless affectation
of surprise, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Upon my word, sir—!” But before she got
any further, she saw reason for real wonder. “Eh!
speaking of ears, what has happened to yours?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Honourably sacrificed in war, miss,” replied
Filson, readily; “slashed by a Jacobite officer at
the battle of Culloden, four or five months ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, how barbarious!” cried Prudence. “How
could he ever have the heart to do such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I gave him as good as I got. If you happen
to see a handsome young gentleman with his beauty
improved by a mark like a heart on a playing-card,
under his right eye, you may know that he owes that
decoration to me. I did it with a bayonet, miss,
and a very pretty job I made of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lor, I’m not like ever to see any Jacobite
officer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be too sure. My gentleman is probably
somewhere in this neighbourhood. So keep your
pretty eyes open, my dear. His name is Everell—Charles
Everell—so I was told by a prisoner we
took, who had seen our little exchange of compliments:
though ’tis scarce like he’ll be travelling
under his real name just at present.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, for I hear they’re going to hang all the
Jacobites they catch.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So they are, except the great ones, and them
they behead. They’ve already begun the good work
in London, both ways. Whether this gentleman is
high enough to be honoured with the axe, or
whether his case will be served by a halter, I know
not. He was in the Pretender’s body-guard, at any
rate.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how do you know he’s in this neighbourhood?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because, sweetheart, I saw him yesterday on
the road the first time since Culloden fight. Before
I had a chance to lay information against him, he
had given me the slip. I spent the whole night
in trying to get on his track, at inns and other
houses. I think he may still be in these parts, and if
I can manage it he shall meet his just deserts.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How monstrous bitter you are against him, to
be sure!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. I’m not bitter, my dear. ’Tis only patriotism—loyalty;—’tis
our duty, you know, to bring
any of these rebels to justice when Providence puts
it in our way. And then I’m a persistent man,
too; when I once get on the scent of a thing, I can’t
stop till I’ve run it down. And so, pretty miss,”
he added, playfully, “if you happen to see such
a gentleman, within the next day or two,—young
and good-looking, and most likely travelling with a
friend of about the same age, who’s also a handsome
young man but summat heavier built,—why,
if you see such a gentleman, with the ace of hearts
on his cheek, hold your tongue, and send word to me
in care of this inn—Jeremiah Filson—and I’ll
see you get your share of the reward.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Filson smiled tenderly; and then yawned.
A moment later the landlady called from the entry
that his room was ready.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Remember, my dear, the ace of hearts, and
Jeremiah Filson,” he said, with a parting grin and
wink, and then followed the chambermaid, whom the
landlady had ordered to show him his room. Prudence,
at the entry door, watched him ascend the
stairs till he disappeared at the turn, and heard him
bestow a gallant “my dear” upon the chambermaid
as he continued on his way, whereupon she
tossed her head and became suddenly scornful.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poh! Quite a chivalarious gentleman!” said
she. “Nasty scrub! He may whistle for his Jacobite
with the ace of hearts on his face, for all the help
he gets from me!” With that, Miss Prudence returned
to the kitchen, but sat aloof from the other
servants, who were making merry over their bread
and cheese and beer. The worsting she had got
in a passage of ironical compliments with Lady
Strange’s maid, which had driven her from the
company to the yard, was still sore in her mind, so
that she sat in contemptuous silence, torn between
the desire to tell the others of the Jacobite-hunting
guest and the satisfaction of keeping them deprived
of subject-matter so interesting. She flattered herself
that she was the only person in the house whom
Mr. Filson had taken into his confidence; and this
was true, though on his arrival he had looked into
all the public parts of the inn and questioned the
landlord as to the guests up-stairs. His disclosure
to her had followed naturally upon her notice of his
ear.</p>

<p class='c012'>Filson, being ushered into one of the back chambers,
bade the maid have his portmanteau brought up
from the public room. He then took off his shoes
and threw himself on the bed. The boy who carried
up the portmanteau, two minutes later, found him
snoring.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Filson had not been asleep five minutes, when
three horsemen—the three that have been mentioned
more than once hitherto in the course of
this history—turned in from the street, and came
to a stop at the door to the public room. Two of
the riders slid from their saddles, and the third,—the
postboy in charge,—after dropping two cloak-bags
beside the door, proceeded with the horses
to the yard. The two gentlemen—for gentlemen
they were, as was plain from every appearance,
though their clothes had seen considerable service—stood
for a moment glancing around. They were
young and well favoured; both of average height;
one stoutly made, the other of a slighter build. The
slender fellow had a small red scar, which indeed
was rather like a heart in shape, on his right cheek;
but it did not apparently spoil the beauty of his face.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> slender young gentleman, after his swift survey
of the surroundings, opened the door to the
public dining-room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come along, the place is empty,” he said, and,
picking up one of the cloak-bags, stepped briskly
into the room so recently vacated by Mr. Jeremiah
Filson. “Thank God for a decent-looking inn!”
he added, heartily, tossing his cloak-bag into a corner

<p class='c014'>“Hush!” exclaimed his companion, who had

<p class='c012'>But Charles finished:</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘—lie is my darling,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The young Cheva<i>leer</i>,’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and then answered, gaily: “Why not? We’re
alone here?”</p>

<p class='c016'>The face of the young man—the slender one,
addressed by his comrade as Charles—was not
only handsome, but pleasant and animated, being
lighted by soft blue eyes. The nose was slightly
aquiline, the other features regular. He wore his
own hair; his old suit of blue velvet carried an
appearance of faded elegance; his three-cornered
hat still boasted some remnants of silver lace; he
was in riding-boots, and a sword hung at his side.</p>
<p class='c012'>His comrade, more broadly and squarely made in
face as in body, a man serious and resolute in
aspect, was similarly dressed, in clothes now in their
decline but of a darker shade.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, alone here,” said he, putting his bag with
the other’s, “but ’tis as well to leave off habits that
may be dangerous. You might as easily break out
into one of the old ditties in company as alone.
I dare say nobody finds any harm in the mere
singing of them; but ’tis apt to set people’s minds
on certain matters, and we’d best not have them
think of those matters in relation to us. We excite
curiosity enough, I make no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only your fancy, Will. Why should we excite
more curiosity than any other two travellers?”
said Charles. “What is so extraordinary in our appearance?
Come, I’ve asked you a hundred times,
and you can’t answer. Your constitutional prudence,
your natural cautiousness, which you know
I vastly admire and try to emulate—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Will smiled at this.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Those excellent traits of thine, dear lad,”
Charles went on, “cause you to magnify things, or
rather to transfigure them altogether, so that, if
anybody looks at us, you see suspicion where there
is really nothing but the careless curiosity of a
moment. Where he says in his mind, ‘Strangers,’
you can almost hear him saying with his lips,
‘Jacobites.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hush! You may laugh as you please, Charles:
prudence and caution, even carried to excess, are
likelier to serve our turn than carelessness and boldness,
till we are safe out of England.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, there again! You are more apprehensive
a thousand times since we have crossed the border
than you were during all the time in Scotland, all
the hiding time, and the time of dodging enemies
on the alert for us in every direction.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I confess it. As one nears the end of a difficult
or dangerous business, one should be the more
fearful of disaster. Think how it may turn to
naught all the toils that have brought one so far.
Never relax because the goal is in sight: if you
trip at the last, and through your own folly, too,
’tis the more to be regretted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All true, my dear Roughwood; and yet, for
our peace of mind, ’tis comforting to think how
much safer we really are in England than we were
across the border. Nobody expects to find Jacobites
on the highroads of England.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There have been far too many seen on the highroads
of England lately,” said Roughwood, with a
gloomy smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, yes, the poor fellows now at Carlisle and
York,” replied Charles; “but Jacobites uncaught
are a different matter. They are all thought to be
skulking in the Highlands, the Duke of Cumberland’s
soldiers closing nearer and nearer round
them. Heaven send that the Prince may escape!
Would that his chances were as good as ours! ’Tis
probable every mile of the Scottish coast is patrolled
by government vessels, as every foot of the Highlands
is hunted over by regulars and militia—or
will be hunted over, ere all is done. ’Twas high
time we left our quarters among the rocks and
heather, and a miracle of good luck that we slipped
through the enemy’s lines and across the border.
England is the safer land for us, and vastly easier
to escape from by sea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Their talk was interrupted by the entrance of
the landlady, who took their orders for dinner, after
which meal they intended to resume their journey.
When they were again alone, Charles continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“So, my dear lad, as I was about to say, let us
be easy in our minds, put away apprehensions, and
avoid suspicion by showing no expectation of it.
Your mad resolve to come to England and see the
beloved lady before you flee the kingdom, turns out
to be the wisest course we could have taken.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wise or mad, my dear Everell,” said Will
Roughwood, “I’d have taken it at any risk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And wise or mad,” said Everell, gaily, “I’d
have followed you at any risk—for company’s
sake, to say no more. But indeed there’s less risk
for me than you. Very few people in England
know my face: ever since boyhood, my life has
been spent abroad, until I joined the Prince. ’Tis
different with you, who were brought up almost
entirely within the two kingdoms. Egad, there’s
the advantage I derive from my father having been
the complete Jacobite—one of those who, for all
their love of country, preferred exile in order to be
at the centre of the plotting.” The young man
smiled to think how all that plotting for a second
Stuart restoration had come to naught.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s chance of recognition for you, too,”
said Roughwood. “Consider how many people
saw you when we invaded these Northern counties
last year. And consider those of our own party
who have turned traitor, buying their lives by informing
against their comrades. And we are in
constant danger of encountering men who fought
against us, like that fellow we dodged so narrowly
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, he and I had our particular reasons for
remembering each other,” said Everell, touching the
scar on his cheek. “’Tis not in chance that we
should run across him again. One such coincidence
is remarkable enough.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who can tell? In any case, he is not the only
soldier of the enemy who would remember us. We
are like to fall in with more; and ’tis of such, as all
accounts agree, that most of the witnesses are, who
have testified at Carlisle and York.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, then, such are to be looked for in Carlisle
and York at present, except those who are in
London for the like purpose. We have given Carlisle
a wide berth, we will steer clear of York, and
we’ll not go to London. And it may be that those
of the enemy who remember us are still with the
army in Scotland, hunting down our comrades.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Roughwood smiled at his friend’s habitual power
of seeing the favourable possibilities and ignoring
the adverse; and could not help wondering that
fortune had brought him unscathed through so many
hazards in all the months of flight and concealment
since that fatal day of defeat in the wind and snowfall
on Culloden Moor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll run into trouble yet, I’m fearing,” said
Roughwood, with solicitude and affection in his
smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As for mere busybodies here in England,”
Charles Everell continued, apparently bent upon disposing
of every class from which discovery might
be possible; “people to whom the idea of fugitive
Jacobites might occur at this time, they will not
look to find officers travelling openly as gentlemen.
They will suppose that fugitives of our quality, if
any fled into England at all, would come disguised.
Going boldly in the dress and manner of gentlemen,
wearing swords and showing no secrecy, how can
we excite suspicion? We have nothing to fear
but some unlucky chance meeting, like that we galloped
away from yesterday; and the same accident
is not like to befall us again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if that fellow who recognized you should
have taken it into his head to hound us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is he likely to have put himself to the trouble?
Doubtless he has his own affairs to pursue. Be
that as it may, we got rid of him easily enough
by spurring our horses and turning out of the road
at the next byway; and, if forced to it, we can do
so again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We may not have the same advantage again.
If there had been anybody at hand yesterday, I
am sure he would have called out and denounced
us. I don’t forget his look when he first saw us,
as he stood in front of that wayside ale-house. He
was about touching his hat to us as we rode up,
when he beheld your face. His hand remained fixed
in the air, and he stared as if you had been the
devil. Then he glanced wildly around, and in at
the ale-house door; he was certainly looking to
see if help was in call.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Twas a question for an instant whether I
should run my sword through him,” said Everell,
“but thank God such impulses never prevail with
me. So I merely decided not to stop at that house
of refreshment, and gave my horse the spur. And
you were good enough to follow without question,
which speaks well for your wisdom and my own,
my dear Will. Always do so, and we shall always
have similar good fortune in escaping the perils that
beset us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I would I knew what our guide thought of the
incident, and of our bribing him to let his horses
come so far out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He thought merely as I told him, no doubt:—in
the first case, that my horse bolted, and that I
took it as an omen against stopping there; in the
second, that we really had a friend whose house
we thought to find by turning out of the way. But
whatever he may have thought, he was a mum
fellow, and doubtless went to bed as soon as we
arrived at last night’s inn; therefore he probably
had no speech with the lad who took his place this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well,” said Roughwood, smilingly resigning
himself to the other’s sense of security, “I hope
your confidence will be justified to the end of the
journey. But when we come to my own county,
where I am well known, there indeed we must needs
go warily.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, then, of course, we shall stir only by
night,” said Everell. “And we shall not tarry long,
if all goes well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only till I can see her,” replied his friend, in a
voice low with sadness and tenderness. A brief
silence fell between the two young men, till Roughwood
added, “One last meeting! And then to part,—for
how long, God knows!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you may come back to England safely in
two or three years. When the government has made
examples enough, there will be a general pardon;
or at worst a Jacobite may slink back and his
presence be winked at. So much if our cause be
never revived; if it <i>be</i> revived, we may be able
to come back openly enough.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Roughwood shook his head. “’Twill never be
revived to any purpose. We can never rally a larger
force than we had this time; yet one can see plainly
now how vain our hopes were from the first. No,
’twas a dream, a dream. The house of Hanover is
firmly established in these kingdoms: the star of
the Stuarts is set. If a general pardon is ever
granted us, it will be for that reason,—because we
can do no harm. But, meanwhile, ’tis the day of
punishment, and we must look to our necks. After
I have seen her, we have only to find Budge, and
lie hid till he happens to be sailing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The arrival of a maid with their dinner put a
stop for the time to this kind of conversation, in
which they but reviewed their situation as they had
done a score of times within the past few days.
They had ordered frugally, out of respect to the
state of their common purse, which they counted
upon to carry them to the place near which lived both
Roughwood’s affianced wife—with whom it was
his hope to exchange assurances of faith and devotion
ere he fled his native country—and the master
of a certain vessel, upon whom he relied for their
conveyance across the channel. Roughwood had
relations at this place, but, as they sympathized not
with his Jacobitism, which he had acquired through
his Scottish kin, he considered it imprudent to seek
a further supply of money from them. Once in
France, however, he could communicate in safety
with his sources of maintenance. As for Everell,
the modest but sufficient fortune he inherited from
his Jacobite father had long been placed in France,
and would be at his command as soon as he reached
Paris. The young men were now travelling upon
the remainder of the gold with which both had
fortunately been supplied a few days before the
battle of Culloden. They had not had occasion to
spend money during the months of concealment
immediately following upon the total defeat of their
cause at that contest, their hiding-place—first a
“bothy” and afterwards a cave—having been on
the estate of a Highland gentleman who shared in
their seclusion, and by whose adherents he and they
were fed.</p>

<p class='c012'>To this comrade in defeat they owed also the
clothes they now wore, as they had considered it
better advised to appear as ordinary gentlemen in
their journey through England, than to use a disguise
which it would require some acting to carry
off. Having lived a part of his time in the great
world, this Highland laird was possessed of a considerable
wardrobe besides that limited to the national
dress, and in order to furnish out his two friends
he had risked with them a secret visit by night to
his own mansion, which was under the intermittent
watch of government troops. The gentleman was
of a build rather lighter than Roughwood and
stouter than Everell, so that his loosest set of garments
was not impossible of wear to the former,
and his tightest did not hang too limply on the
body of the latter. Discarding entirely their battle-worn
and earth-soiled clothes for these, and otherwise
altering and augmenting their equipment at
their friend’s expense, the two fugitives had, by
travelling at night and making a carefully planned
dash at the most critical point, put themselves outside
of the region surrounded by the Duke of
Cumberland’s forces. Thereafter they had dared
to move by day, hiring horses; and either Everell’s
boldness or Roughwood’s caution, or both, had carried
them so far without other adverse chance than
the meeting with the man who remembered Everell
from their encounter at Culloden. Being without
passports, they had avoided every place where troops
were said to be stationed, and in crossing the border
they had kept to the moors instead of the roads:
for their eccentric manner of travelling, their invention
was equal to such pretexts as the curiosity
of horse-boys and others might require.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the servant left them to their dinner, they
reverted to their former subject, talking as they
ate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis all plain sailing, to my sight,” said Everell,
cheerfully, “until we entrust our precious bodies
to the care of your friend the smuggler.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll warrant Budge to be true stuff,” replied
Roughwood, confidently. “He would risk his cutter
to save my neck. We used to play with his
children on the cliffs, he and I.—And now I shall
be looking on those cliffs for the last time, perhaps,—and
on England! Well, ’tis the fate of losers
in the game of rebellion.” He made no attempt
to restrain the sigh this melancholy reflection
evoked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tut, tut, lad!” protested Everell, with unfeigned
lightness of heart; “take my word for it, a man
can live out of England. What is it Shakespeare
says, that my father used to quote when our fellow-countrymen
visiting us would commiserate our
exile? ‘There’s livers out of Britain.’ And that
speech of Coriolanus, too: ‘I turned my back upon
my native city and found a world elsewhere.’
’Twould surprise some Englishmen to be convinced
of it, I know, but indeed there is a world elsewhere.
’Tis a lovely country, Britain, I grant you, and
would be my choice for living in, when all’s said
and done, but—there’s livers out of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You talk as if ’twere only the leaving England,”
said the other, with a sorrowful smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell was silent a moment, gazing at his friend
as if to make out some sort of puzzle which had
repeatedly baffled him. “Sure, ’tis more than I
can understand,” he said, at last. “For that lady I
have the profound respect and admiration which
your own regard for her declares her due; for every
lady who merits them I have respect and admiration:
but this power of love, as I see it manifested
in you! Give me leave, on the score of our friendship,
to confide that it astonishes me. How a man
can fret his soul over a woman, be miserable at
the idea of parting from her, risk his life for a
meeting with her—for though we find it the safer
course now, it <i>was</i> risking our lives to make that
dash through the enemy’s lines and across the lowlands—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yet you risked yours readily enough for mere
friendship’s sake,” said Roughwood, breaking in
upon the parenthesis, and so wrecking the sentence
for ever.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For friendship’s sake, yes!—brave comradeship,
good company!—indeed, yes, and who would not?
But for love of a girl!—why, ’tis worthy of Don
Quixote! Forgive me: I speak only my mind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lad, lad, what is friendship in comparison with
love of a girl—real love of a girl? You’ll sing
another tune some day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never! I can assure you, never. I know not
what the disease is, of which you speak. Certainly
I’m now old enough to have had it if I ever was
to be attacked.—Not that I don’t admire the beauty
of women, and commend them for their gentleness,—when
they <i>are</i> gentle,—and compassionate their
weakness as I do that of children, and find pleasure
in their smiling faces, and soft eyes, and tender
blushes. I can take joy enough in the society of
a pretty creature when it falls my lot, and count it
among the other amenities of life. I value the
grace and goodness that high-minded women diffuse
in this rough world. I can be happy with sensible
women, and amuse myself with light ones. But as
to being what you call <i>in love</i>, I have not fallen into
that strange condition, and I can promise you I
never shall. ’Tis not in my constitution.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The day will come, and the disease be all the
worse for being late, as is the case with other
ailments delayed beyond the usual time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, sir: and as for hazarding life for love of
a woman, I must tell you I put a higher value upon
life than that implies. You understand me—for
<i>love</i> of a woman. To save a woman in danger,
to serve a woman in any way, is a different matter.
But merely to participate in the absurdities of love,
to exchange assurances and go through the rest
of the comedy,—will you have me believe ’tis
worth staking such a gift as life for? Pretty odds,
egad!—life against love! Love, which is at most
an incident, against life, which is everything and
includes all incidents! Love, against the possibilities
of who knows how many years! My dear Will!—and
yet you say I am rash.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am glad to find you a convert to a sense
of the value of life,” laughed Will.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, you don’t think I have held life cheap
because I have sometimes ventured it perhaps without
much hesitation? Be sure I have always known
what I was doing. There has always been, as there
is now, a good chance of winning through. I have
not lagged behind the boldest in a fight, ’tis true—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Except in a retreat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, well, it broke my heart to fly from the
field at Culloden. When I thought of the Prince
and his hopes—when I perceived that all was ended
in the whirling snow of that bleak day—I forgot
myself. For a moment life did seem of little worth;
not that I ever had the cause so much at heart, but
’twas a sad end of a brave adventure, and I felt
what was passing in the Prince’s mind. I tarried
for a last stroke of protest, and a pity it is it fell
on no better object than a dog whose only business
on the field was plunder,—for I don’t think that
fellow was a true soldier; ’twas by fool’s luck he
pinked me with his bayonet.—But, deuce take it,
where was I? Ah, yes. If I’ve been venturesome
now and again, I have never felt that the danger
was more than my arm and eye were equal to,—and
that’s not rashness, Will. A man is a fool
who doesn’t hold life precious. If it isn’t precious,
what’s the merit in risking it for a good cause?
There are so many fine things to see and do when
one is alive, ’tis sheer lunacy to place them all in
the balance against a trifle. As for the satisfaction
of looking on a pretty face for a greater or less
space of time,—no, ’tis not enough.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait till you see the right face, dear lad,” said
Roughwood, quietly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When I do, dear lad, you shall hear of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Upon this speech, blithely uttered, Everell filled
their two glasses with wine from the single bottle
they had ordered. The young men were about to
pledge each other, when the sudden opening of the
door caused them to look sharply in that direction,
holding their glasses midway between table and lips.
A young lady came in with quick steps. At sight
of the gentlemen, she stopped at once, and looked
sweetly embarrassed. Everell and Roughwood rose
to their feet, and bowed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your pardon, sirs,” said the intruder. “I was—I
wanted to see Prudence.” Her confusion, to
which was due the strangeness of this remark,
became all the greater on her perceiving that
strangeness, and she blushed deeply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Prudence?” echoed Everell, politely. “If you
mean a lady of that name, we have not seen her
here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She is my waiting-woman,” explained Georgiana.
“I didn’t expect to find her in this room.
She is in the kitchen, no doubt, so I thought of
coming to this room and ringing the bell. I thought
there might be nobody here, but I see I intrude.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not in the least,” said Everell, earnestly. “You
arrive just in time to provide us with a toast. To
those sweet eyes!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was about to drink, when the new wave of
crimson that swept over her face at this tenderly
spoken praise of her visual organs engendered a
sudden abashment in Everell. “I have been too
bold, perhaps,” he said, in a kind of vague alarm.
“If so, I entreat your pardon, madam.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She looked at him with undisguised interest, and
said, slowly, “I know not. If you are bold, there
seems a respect in your boldness,—a gentleness
and a consideration—” She stopped short, as having
gone too far. A slight quiver of the lip, and
a certain note of resentment in her last words, combined
with the words themselves, conveyed a message
to his quick wit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Madam, some one has offended you,” he said,
instantly setting down his wine, and walking toward
her and the door. “Where is the person?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She raised her hand to check him, frightened at
having created the possibility of a scene. “Nay,
’tis nothing! Stay, I beg you, sir!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who could be ungentle to one who is all gentleness?”
cried Everell. “It must have occurred but
now—they must be near—in this inn. In what
room? Pray tell me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Twas nothing, sir, I assure you. I spoke in
a moment of foolish vexation. I was merely annoyed
at their talk. I had no right to be—no
offence was meant.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“People should be careful that offence is not
given, as well as not meant. They should be chastised
for their carelessness, if for nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, it is not to be heard of. Two of them
are of my own sex, and another is my relation. I
had no real cause to be angry. The fault is all
mine, indeed. I have been much in the wrong to
leave them so rudely,—and more in the wrong to
speak of the matter to a stranger. Pray forget all
I have said, sir,—pray do, as you are a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He had been on the point of answering at the
end of each sentence, but her rapidity of speech
prevented. She stopped now, with a look that continued
her appeal and besought an assurance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As I am a gentleman,” said Everell, “I will
obey your least command—or your greatest. But
as I am a gentleman, I would not have you consider
me as a stranger. I grant we have never met before;
but such true and gentle eyes as yours make
friends of all who are privileged to see them. As
for my own deserts, I can plead only the respect
and tenderness your looks compel. Believe me,
nothing in the suddenness of this meeting can make
me act lightly toward you, or think lightly of you,
if you will do me the honour to count me among
your friends. My name is—”</p>

<p class='c012'>A loud “hem” from Roughwood, who had been
looking on with astonishment at his friend’s earnest
and precipitate demonstration of regard, made
Everell stop short. Georgiana, who had listened
and gazed with a bewilderment that had something
exceedingly novel and pleasant in it, was at a loss
how to fill the pause with speech or act. She stood
feeling quite incapable and delighted; but her face
betrayed nothing unusual except wonder, which very
well became it. Everell, however, did not leave her
long suspended. With a smile at his own predicament,
he resumed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Egad, I have a choice of names to tell, madam.
For certain reasons, I don’t parade my true name
at present.—And yet why not in this case? I
wouldn’t deal in falsehood even so slight, with one
whose looks declare—”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Georgiana had suddenly recalled her wits to
their duty, and they had promptly informed her how
the world would expect a young lady to comport
herself in such a situation. She quietly interrupted:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, sir, I haven’t asked your name, and there
is no need you should tell it, as we are not likely
to meet again. I thank you for your willingness
to befriend me, and your offer of service.—There
is one thing you may do for me, if you will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The dejected look that had come over Everell’s
face flashed into eagerness, and he started forward.
“Name it, madam!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana smiled, but said as sweetly as possible,
to compensate in some measure for the disappointment
she foresaw too late, “If you will pull the
bell-rope yonder, I shall be very grateful—<i>most</i>
grateful.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell’s looks groaned for him, and he was too
far taken down to move. Roughwood laughed
gently, and after a moment, as he was nearer the
bell-rope, went toward it. This restored Everell to
animation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, Will, ’tis <i>my</i> affair!” he cried, and, stepping
between his friend and the rope, gave it so
earnest a pull, with such a flourish, that anybody
must have marvelled to see how serious and magnificent
a performance the pulling of a bell-rope
could be made.</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana thanked him, and stood smiling, with
nothing more to say. Everell found himself afflicted
with a similar lack, or confusion, of ideas, as well
as from inability to take his eyes off the young lady.
She sought relief from his gaze by walking to the
window. Presently the maid appeared, in response
to the bell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell my waiting-woman to come to me,” said
Georgiana. The maid having gone, another space
of embarrassment ensued, until Georgiana was fain
to break the silence by an ill-simulated cough. This
was followed by a profound sigh on the part of
Everell, who had indeed never been so tongue-tied
in his life. Roughwood meanwhile stood witnessing
with amusement. He was not the sort of man
to come to the rescue at such junctures in any case,
being of a reserved disposition, and he was certainly
not inclined to pity the discomposure of his gay and
confident friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last Prudence made her appearance, with
officious haste and solicitude. “What is it, your
la’ship?” Seeing the gentlemen, she turned her
glance upon them before her mistress could answer.
“Oh, lor!” she cried, and stood stock-still, staring
open-mouthed at Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Prudence! what do you mean?” said Georgiana.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, lor!” repeated the girl. “The gentleman
with the heart! Under his right eye, too! The
very place!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Prudence, what impertinence! Have you lost
your senses?—Sir, I beg pardon for the poor girl.
I don’t know what she means, but no harm, I’m
certain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, mistress, your la’ship, come away!” begged
Prudence, and, taking hold of Georgiana’s sleeve,
essayed to draw her from the room. In astonishment,
and hope of learning the cause of this extraordinary
conduct, Georgiana made a brief curtsey
to the gentlemen, and followed the maid out to the
passage, where she bade her explain herself. But
Prudence was not content till she had led her mistress
into the opposite entry and partly up the stairs,
whither it was impossible for the gaze of the two
gentlemen to reach them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell, quite heedless of the maid’s behaviour,
had started forward with a stifled exclamation of
protest when Georgiana had moved to leave them.
He had stopped before arriving at the door, of
course; and now that she had disappeared from
view across the passage, he turned to Roughwood
with a forlorn countenance. Roughwood, however,
was in no mood for either sympathy or rallying.
Prudence’s demonstration had worked its full effect
upon him, and his brow was now grave with concern.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you ever see such angelic sweetness, such
divine gentleness?” asked Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you attend to what her waiting-woman
said?” replied Roughwood, rather sharply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Something about my heart, or my eye, was it
not? Sure, my heart may well have been in my
eyes, when they looked on that lovely creature.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She was noticing the scar on your face. She
has heard you described, no doubt. News of us
has travelled along the road. ’Tis the work of the
fellow we saw yesterday, I dare say. How often did
I beg you to cover that scar with a patch?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pshaw, you always see the worst possibility.
The boy with the horses has been talking of us in
the kitchen, that’s all. He has invented some wild
tale of us, as those people do of their masters and
employers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We had best order fresh horses, and pay the
reckoning; and meanwhile finish our wine—it may
be some time before we think it safe to stop long
at another inn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He stepped toward the bell-rope, but Everell
again intervened, with the words:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, if any report of us has gone about, a
hasty departure is the very thing to confirm suspicion.
Nothing in haste:—my dear Will, how
often have I heard you give that good counsel.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There will be no apparent haste. We have
dined without hurry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell sighed, and looked toward the door. His
face brightened.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if we wait here awhile, we may—don’t
you know—perhaps we can—we may learn why
that waiting-woman cried out at the sight of my
scar,—for, look you, if we should meet the mistress
again, no doubt, if it is something harmless—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“At least,” said Roughwood, firmly, “I will ring
and give orders and pay. Even if you still feel
inclined to tarry, there’s no harm in being ready
to go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell could not reasonably dispute this, but he
was so little inclined to take a hand in anything
implying an immediate departure, that he left all
to his friend, and sat looking through the open door
while Roughwood gave orders and paid the landlady.
Nothing occurred to reward his watch during
the first few minutes that passed while horses were
being made ready. He took up the glass that
Roughwood gently pushed to his hand, and drank
down the wine half-consciously. He dreaded to see
the horses appear, knowing that his comrade must
have his way, and that he should probably never
again behold the vision that had suddenly gladdened
his sight and warmed his heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>But meanwhile there had been activity in the yard,
and now there was a great stamping of hoofs and
rattling of harness, accompanied by the ejaculations
peculiar to men who have to do with horses. Roughwood
went to the door and looked toward the yard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis a coach-and-six making ready to depart,”
he said. “And there’s a post-chaise, too. We are
not the only people who are about to leave this inn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell was by his side in an instant. No doubt,
then, the young lady would be leaving. A fat
coachman was on the box of the private vehicle,
and the postilion was in readiness to mount before
the chaise, but the passengers of neither were yet
visible. There came, however, from across the passage
the sound of well-bred voices, in easy, half-jesting
tones, and then appeared a sumptuously
charming lady on the arm of a handsome, discontented-looking
gentleman; a second couple, not as
distinguished in appearance; and the young lady
who had so fired Everell’s fancy. The party moved
toward the conveyances, Georgiana having no share
in their mirthful talk. She had cast a quick glance
at the two young gentlemen while her face was
toward them, but had given no sign of acquaintance.
A second procession, consisting of the waiting-women
and men servants with the smaller impedimenta,
followed in the footsteps of the gentlefolk,
and Georgiana’s figure was almost lost to view in
the crowd about the carriages, which was now
swelled by the people of the inn.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Which way can they be going? Who is she?
If I could but learn where she lives!” said Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The knowledge would serve you little at present,
I fear,” replied Roughwood.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Those are the people whose talk offended her.
One is her relation, she said. By Jupiter, I must
find out!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ere his friend could stop him Everell had started
for the yard, as if upon his own business, with some
general idea of questioning the inn folk. Going
near the travellers, he heard the two strange ladies
and one of the gentlemen discussing how the party
should be divided between the coach and the chaise.
The taller gentleman was speaking to the landlady.
The word “baggage” caught Everell’s ear, and he
stood still.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are three trunks following by the
wagon,” the gentleman was saying, “to be left
here. You will have Timmins the carter fetch them
to Foxwell Court immediately.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell needed to hear no more. The party was
evidently bound for Foxwell Court, which must be
near if the baggage following thus far by regular
wagon was to be conveyed the rest of the way by
a local carter. And of course the place must be
off the route of the stage-wagons—that is to say,
off the great highway. Three trunks would have
been small luggage for so numerous a party of such
quality; but Everell saw baggage on the coach, as
well. This, in fact, belonged to Lady Strange and
her party. That about which he had heard directions
given was of Georgiana and her uncle.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell was on the edge of the little crowd, and
he turned about to look toward the midst of it,
where he had last caught a glimpse of the young
lady. To his wonder, he now beheld her close in
front of him, her eyes meeting his.</p>

<div id='i101'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i101.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“‘SAVE YOURSELF,’ SHE WHISPERED, RAPIDLY. ‘YOU ARE IN DANGER HERE.’”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Save yourself,” she whispered, rapidly. “You
are in danger here. A man is up-stairs who is
hunting you—one Jeremiah Filson. For heaven’s
sake, fly while you may!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Before he could answer, she had slipped back
through the crowd, and was in her former place,
near the two older ladies. The attention of the
lesser folk was upon the London people, who were
concerned only with one another, and the tall gentleman
was still engaged with the woman of the inn.
No one had observed Georgiana.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>At</span> last the tall gentleman turned to his friends.
Everell saw Georgiana disappear into the coach
with the older ladies; saw the two gentlemen spring
into the chaise, after casting doles to the yard servants;
saw the two maids established upon outside
seats, the valets mounted, the postilion up before
the chaise, the coachman gather his reins and whip;
saw the procession move off, with Caleb at the head
to show the way, the coach next, the chaise following,
and the trim London lackey riding behind all
the rest. Everell followed as far as to the door,
where still stood Roughwood. The coach had already
turned down the High Street.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She’s gone,” said he. “But not far—only to
Foxwell Court.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pray, where and what is Foxwell Court?”
asked Roughwood, leading him by the arm into
the parlour.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know not, but ’tis easily learned.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No doubt, but we shall do better to restrain our
curiosity. I trust we shall have nothing more to
excite it—or to tempt you to mingle unnecessarily
in miscellaneous crowds from inn kitchens.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear Will,” cried Everell, “my going among
that crowd was a stroke of heaven-sent luck. I
received a most valuable warning—and from her,
too! Think of it, those sweet lips, those heavenly
eyes, that—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Warning? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell told him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“H’m!” said Roughwood. “That explains her
maid’s conduct. Somebody had described you to the
maid—somebody now up-stairs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and the maid no sooner tells her of it than
she takes the first opportunity to put us on our
guard, at the risk even of her good name. What
divine compassion! What—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the somebody up-stairs? No doubt your
acquaintance of yesterday. Why, he may chance
upon us at any moment, and give the alarm. And,
if he has mentioned you to the maid, why not to
a whole kitchenful of people? ’Tis high time indeed
we were out of this place. How slow they are
with the horses! We should be in another county
by sunset.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, dear Will, <i>you</i> should—and must.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>I</i> should? <i>We</i> should. Here are the horses
at last. Come.” Roughwood seized the cloak-bags.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, Will, I—I will follow a little later,”
said Everell, taking his own piece of luggage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Later? Are you mad?—Come, come, no nonsense,
Charles. You will go with me, of course.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“From this inn, certainly. But from this neighbourhood
not for a—day or two. I mention it
now, so that the boy need hear no discussion between
us. I will ride with you a mile or so, then take
my own way afoot. The boy, of course, must keep
his horses together.—I will follow you, I say: I
can find your man Budge. Let his house be our
rendezvous,—I can find it from your description,—and
of course I will appear thereabouts only
at night. Instruct him to be on the watch for me.
If he can sail before I arrive, make good your own
escape, and bid him expect me on his return. That
is all, I think; and now to horse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, my dear lad,—my dear, dear lad,—what
folly is this? Hear reason; you must be
guided by me. You know not what you would
risk—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No more than I’ve risked before now, and for
no such cause, either. ’Tis settled, Will, I intend
to stay hereabouts till I’ve seen that young lady
again. Come, the boy is waiting with the horses.
’Tis you now that delays our going.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Charles, listen to me!—Rash! foolish! mad!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No.—I said you should hear when I saw the
right face, Will. I declare I’ve seen it—and must
see it again, whatever be the cost or the consequence.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In another minute they were on horseback, moving
down the High Street. The coach and chaise
had started in the same direction, but were now out
of sight. Everell hoped to come nearly up to them,
that he might see where they left the highroad.
But even after he had cleared the town and beheld
a straight stretch of road far ahead, he found no
sign of the vehicles in which he was interested.
He inferred that they must have turned off through
one of the streets of the town, which was indeed the
case.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, Roughwood, full of sadness and misgiving,
had kept up his usual vigilance so far as
to watch their guide for possible signs of having
heard any such talk at the inn as had enabled the
maid Prudence to identify Everell. But the boy
did not regard either of the gentlemen at all suspiciously;
he showed no curiosity or interest, and
Roughwood was assured that, if Everell’s enemy
had spoken of them at the inn, this lad had not been
a listener. Such, as the reader knows, was the case,
for Mr. Filson had thus far confided his story to
nobody in the house but Prudence, and she had excluded
herself from the conversation of the kitchen
under a sense of affront, until summoned by her
mistress. Georgiana, upon hearing the cause of her
alarm at the sight of the young stranger, had put
the girl under the strictest commands of secrecy,
and had kept her in attendance afterward, quietly
returning to Foxwell and his friends as they were
making ready to depart.</p>

<p class='c012'>While he still rode with his friend, Everell allowed
no mention of his resolve or of Foxwell
Court to escape him, for he knew that the guide,
whom Roughwood would dismiss at the end of that
stage, would be returning with the horses, and might
be interrogated by their enemy, who by that time
would probably have learned of their short stay
at the inn. On the other hand, Everell devoted some
conversation to the purpose of deceiving the boy
as to his reasons and intentions in leaving his friend
and his saddle as he was about to do. Observing
a house among some trees upon a hill, he pointed
it out to Roughwood as the residence of a friend
whom he meant to surprise with a brief visit. Having
spoken to this effect, as if the matter had been
previously understood between them, he added
that, in order to make the surprise complete, he
would approach the house on foot among the trees,
and would therefore take leave of Roughwood, for
the time, in the road. He could depend upon the
gentleman he was about to visit to furnish him with
conveyance to the next town, whence he would follow
Roughwood by post-horse. This much having
been said in the guide’s hearing, Everell pulled up
his horse, and, Roughwood doing likewise, the two
fugitives held a whispered conference upon the details
of their next reunion.</p>

<p class='c012'>To the last, Roughwood tried, by voice and look,
to dissuade his comrade from this rash and sudden
deviation from their original plans, but vainly.
They made a redivision of their money, for each in
his heart felt that some time must elapse ere they
should—if ever—be fellow travellers again.
Then Everell slid from his horse, slung his cloak-bag
over his shoulder, gave a quick pressure of his
friend’s hand, and a whispered “God speed you,
dear lad!” in exchange for a silent and protesting
farewell in the other’s clouding eyes; and stood
alone in the highway. He waited till the horses
disappeared with a last wave of Roughwood’s hand,
around a turning: he then faced directly about,
and set off with long and rapid strides.</p>

<p class='c012'>His pace very soon brought him back to the town
he had so recently left. Instead of going as far
as to their former inn, he sought out one of humbler
appearance, near the beginning of the street.
Here he left his cloak-bag, for already in his brief
walk he had experienced the stares of wonder naturally
drawn by a gentleman who carried at the
same time a sword at his side and a cloak-bag at
his shoulder. He went into a barber’s shop, where,
as he had used his razor that morning, and very
little sign of beard had become visible in the meantime,
his order for shaving created in the barber’s
mind an impression that he must be an extremely
luxurious gentleman in spite of his threadbare
clothes,—probably a lord in misfortune. Everell
easily set the barber talking about all the estates in
the neighbourhood, and thus, without seeming to
have more design in regard to Foxwell Court than
to a dozen other places, elicited the information that
that house was eight miles away on the road to
Burndale.</p>

<p class='c012'>Returning to the inn where he had left his bag,
he told the landlord he was bound for Burndale,
and had made up his mind to accomplish part of
the journey that afternoon, in order to arrive there
betimes the next day. He bargained for a horse
and guide to take him seven or eight miles on the
way, and leave him at some place where he could
pass the night and obtain conveyance on to Burndale
in the morning. In this way, without mentioning
Foxwell Court, he contrived that he should be set
down in its vicinity and yet have it supposed that
his destination was far beyond.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had so far trusted to luck and his quickness
of sight to avoid confrontation with the enemy
who, as he could not doubt, was close enough at
hand. But he breathed a sigh of relief when he
at last rode out of the town in the direction of
Burndale: he believed that, whatever inquiries
might be made upon the discovery that he had passed
through the town, his traces were sufficiently confused,
one set leading southward after his friend,
and the other leading to Burndale, a good distance
beyond Foxwell Court. So he rode forward with
his new guide, in as great security of mind as he
had enjoyed in months.</p>

<p class='c012'>The road lay at first between fields, and here and
there great trees stretched their boughs shelteringly
over it. Sometimes green banks rose on one hand
or both, and at a certain place a stream joined the
road and went singing along in its company for
half a mile. Then the way emerged upon an open
common, which undulated on one side in rounded
waves of heather till the purple mass met the gray
sky, and on the other side to the border of a wood.
But presently Everell was again in cultivated country,
with stone farm-buildings set now and then upon
lawny slopes among the fields.</p>

<p class='c012'>One great house, of which the chimneys rose in
the midst of trees, and which was to be approached
by a driveway of some hundreds of yards from a
gate and lodge at the roadside, held Everell’s attention
for a moment. The guide volunteered the information
that this was Thornby Hall. Everell
repeated the name carelessly, looked a second time,
and thought no more of it. Had he been able to
foresee the future, he would have given the place
a longer inspection.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two or three miles more brought them to a village.
The guide said that here was the only public-house
of entertainment in the near neighbourhood,
and that if he went farther he was in danger of
getting benighted on his return. Nothing could
have suited Everell’s own plan better than this clear
hint. He dissembled his content, however, and
put on a frown of disappointment as he gazed at
the mere ale-house—a low and longish building
whose unevenness of line betokened its antiquity—before
which the boy had drawn up. Everell feigned
a reluctant yielding to necessity; dismounted peevishly,
and showed a petulant resignation in asking
the rustic-looking landlord who appeared at the
door if a decent room was to be had for the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>The landlord, a drowsy little old man, who was
too dull, too humble-minded, or too philosophical
to resent any doubt of the excellence of his house,
replied that the best room was at his honour’s service.
Whereupon Everell, for the hearing of his
guide, inquired urgently about the possibility of
getting a horse in the morning to carry him to
Burndale. Being assured on this point, also, Everell
dismissed the guide, and had his single piece
of baggage taken into his room, which proved to
be not merely the best room, but the only room,
properly so-called, in addition to the long apartment
which served as kitchen, bar, living-room of the
family, and general clubroom of the village; the
chambers up-stairs being mere lofts under the roof.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell ordered a supper of bacon and eggs, which
were cooked by the landlord’s fat, middle-aged
daughter, and served by the old man himself. Turning
quite reconciled to his accommodations as soon
as his guide had left the scene, Everell drew the
host into conversation, and, as the old fellow proved
to be an amiable and honest soul, even in the matter
of his charges, the traveller was shortly in possession
of as many facts, legends, and reports concerning
the gentry of this and adjacent parishes as his
host had accumulated in years. All this information
went through Everell’s mind as through a sieve,
with the exception of the circumstance that the old
red-brick place, with the ivy and the gables, crowning
the slope at the right, with a park behind it,
which old red-brick place his honour would have
seen had he ridden a little farther on, and would
see when he rode that way in the morning, was
Foxwell Court. This piece of news did not come
out till Everell had finished his meal, and he might
have learned a vast deal about the Foxwells, for the
old man’s face brightened as if at the opening of a
fresh and copious subject; but the young gentleman,
with his usual precipitancy, rose and declared his
intention of stretching his legs. Though he had
cautiously refrained from being the first to mention
Foxwell Court, he no sooner knew where it was,
and how near, than he felt himself drawn as by
enchantment in its direction.</p>

<p class='c012'>As he stepped out upon the green space before
the inn, a post-chaise came rattling by at a round
speed. It was empty, and Everell recognized it as
the one which had accompanied the coach from the
inn yard that day: it was now returning from Foxwell
Court, as it ought to have been doing sooner.
The postilion, no doubt, had wasted time in the
sociability of the servants’ hall, and was now making
his horses fly to avoid belatement. He stared a
moment at Everell, and was gone. Thinking nothing
of this meeting, so brief and casual, Everell
walked rapidly off toward Foxwell Court.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sun had come out toward evening, and now
shone bright on the weathercock and spire of the
parish church that stood embowered some distance
from the road, on Everett’s left, as he proceeded.
A short walk brought him to the end of the village
street of low gray cottages in their small gardens.
Thence a little bridge bore him across a stream that
came murmuring down through a large field from
the wooded land Northward. Looking ahead on
that side of the road, he perceived the curved gables
of an old house of time-dulled brick partly clad in
ivy. It stood rather proudly at the top of a broad
slope and against a background of woods or park,
its upper windows ablaze with the sunlight. The
lower part of the building was hidden by the walls
of a forecourt and by a dilapidated-looking gate-house
which dominated them. At the near end of
the mansion appeared a shapeless remnant of broken
tower and wing, ruinous and abandoned: from
these ruins a wall extended to the verge of a slight
precipice and, there turning at a right angle, ran
back to the wood. Over the top of this wall were
visible the signs of a neglected garden or orchard.</p>

<p class='c012'>The further, or Western, end of the house was
flanked by trees and greenery, but the slope of rich
green turf which descended in one long and gentle
swell from the forecourt to the road was clear lawn.
This great convex space of green was separated
from the adjacent fields, and from the road, by a
rude hedge of briar. Everell, having gazed a few
moments from the bridge, walked on along the road,
intending, if possible, to describe the circuit of the
house at a respectful distance before attempting any
near approach. He came to the barred opening in
the hedge through which the private road led from
the highway to the gate-house of the forecourt, but
he let only his eyes travel up the curving way. As
the hedge grew on lower ground beyond the roadside
ditch, Everell had the house in full sight while
he was passing. He came at length to where the
hedge turned for its ascent, and here he found that
a narrow lane ran between it and the field adjoining.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was speedily over the barred gate that shut
this lane from the road. Ascending toward the
park behind the house, he frequently lost sight of
the latter by reason of the height of the hedge, which
was, moreover, accompanied on that side by a line
of oaks. As it came to the level of the forecourt,
the hedge was interrupted by a gate. Looking
across the bars of this, Everell could see not only the
house but, nearer to him, stables and other outbuildings
skilfully concealed by shrubbery and trees.
His observation from the gateway being rewarded
by nothing to the purpose, and that he might make
the most use of the remaining light, Everell went
on through the lane toward the park, to which he
now saw it gave access. Passing the trees which
prevented his view of the Western end of the house,
he came abreast of a terrace which lay between the
North front and the park, and which he could see
across the hedge when he stood on tiptoe. A few
more steps, and a vault over a five-barred gate,
took him into the park itself, from the shades of
which—for it was not kept clear of small growth,
and offered plentiful covert of bush and bracken
and other brush—he gazed upon the house as he
turned and strolled Eastward.</p>

<p class='c012'>The balustrade of the terrace was broken here
and there; and the mansion itself, where the ivy
allowed its surface to be seen, was weather-worn
and unrepaired. Yet, by virtue of its design and
situation, the house had a magnificence. This, however,
did not much affect Everell at the time, sensitive
though he was to such impressions. What
concerned him was, that he saw no face at any
window, nor heard any voice from any part of the
mansion except below stairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>To complete the circuit of the place, in quest of
any discovery to aid his purpose, he walked on till
he came to a deep, thick-wooded glen that cut into
the park from the grounds about the ruined Eastern
end of the house. Through this ran the stream
which, subsequently traversing the great field between
the house and the village, crossed under the
bridge. Everell turned along the crest of the glen-side,
and thus in a few steps emerged, through a
gate in the stone wall, upon the wild garden or
orchard, of which he had seen signs from the road.
It was a neglected place, evidently not now resorted
to. Steps descended to it from the terrace, yet it
was not so much lower but that Everell could glance
along the terrace and the North front of the house.
He leaned against a vacant stone pedestal to rest
and consider.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sun had set, and, far beyond the length of
the terrace, the undulating fields and moorland, and
the distant darkening mountains, was a sky of red
and gold. But Everell had eyes for nothing but
the old mansion, which was to him a case holding
the loveliest jewel he had ever beheld. As the dusk
came on, light appeared at some of the lower windows;
a few notes of laughter and other vocal
sounds gave evidence of life. But nobody came
forth. Everell dared not hope to catch a glimpse
of the admired one that evening. He was at last
sensible that night had fallen. All the colour had
gone out of the West, and stars had appeared.</p>

<p class='c012'>He would have moved, to warm himself by walking,
but that two of the upper windows began to
glow. Were they <i>her</i> windows? He watched with
a beating heart, stilling even the sound of his breath.
But several minutes passed without any manifestation
even of a shadow momentarily darkening the
panes. The light vanished. No doubt she had gone
to bed, fatigued with the journey of the day. Certainly
they must be her windows, for the others
of the party were less likely to retire so early. Everell
heaved a sigh, and threw a kiss at the windows.
Of a sudden he was uncomfortably chilly: he bestirred
himself, wished he had thought of bringing
his cloak, and started off, as much upon a feeling
that he could better meditate a course of procedure
while walking as upon the impulse to set his blood
in motion. But so far was he from any desire of
going back to his inn that, without much conscious
choice in the matter, he took a quite different direction,
and followed the top of the glen-side into the
park.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had been moving at a rapid pace for several
minutes before he gave any heed to his whereabouts.
He had been guided safely among bush, bracken,
and the great trunks of the trees by that unconscious
observation for which in those days there was no
better name than instinct. He now saw—for in
many places the trees were not too close together
for the admission of some light from stars and sky—that
he had penetrated a good distance into the
park, and had left the course of the glen. As he
stood gazing into the gloom, wondering how accurately
he could retrace his steps, he heard the loud
crack of a gun, fired seemingly about two furlongs
away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poachers,” said he, after a moment’s thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>He stepped forward to the edge of an open place,
which sloped down gradually to a stream—doubtless
the same that threaded the glen, or a tributary.
Beyond this water the corresponding ascent was
clear of trees for perhaps a hundred yards. Down
that side of the glade a dark figure was approaching
so swiftly, and in such manner else, that Everell
knew it as that of a man running for his life.
There is a difference so pronounced as to be plain
even in twilight and afar between the attitude of a
man who runs in pursuit, and that of a man who
runs from pursuit; and again, in either case, between
that of one who runs in accordance with, and
that of one who runs in opposition to, the law.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having no desire to interfere with a rogue who
had just fired at, or been fired at by, somebody’s
gamekeeper, or at best had taken a forbidden shot
at somebody’s game, Everell concealed himself
among some bracken of a man’s height. He waited
a few minutes, hoping to be informed by his ears
when the man should have passed. But he heard
neither footfall nor panting, nor any noise of pursuit.</p>

<p class='c012'>Supposing that the fellow had changed his course
at the stream, Everell stepped out from the bracken.
He was just in time to confront a broad figure
striding toward him. Ere Everell thought of self-defence,
the newcomer uttered an ejaculation, and
sprang aside with something upraised in the air.
The next thing that Everell knew—for one rarely
feels a knock-down blow on the head from such
an instrument as the butt-end of a gun—he was
lying among the bracken from which he had recently
come forth.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c007'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THANKS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>At</span> his side knelt the man who had felled him,
and who was endeavouring to ascertain if he still
breathed. Everell essayed to grasp his sword-hilt,
but the other caught his wrist with a powerful hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Softly, master,” said a gruff but apparently
pacific voice. “’Tis all a mistake, belike, and, if
so be it is, I ask your pardon humbly. I make you
out to be a gentleman, sir, and in that case not what
I supposed. But you appeared so sudden, I took
it you’d been lying in wait for me. I struck out
first, and thought afterwards, which was maybe the
wrong way about. So I stayed to see what hurt
was done, and lend a hand if need be.—Nay, you’ll
find I haven’t touched your pockets, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Forgetting the injury in the chivalrous after-conduct—for
nine men out of ten would have run
away, whether the blow had been mistaken or
not—Everell replied as heartily as he could:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, friend, you seem a very brave fellow, and
I forgive you the mistake. As for harm, I do begin
to feel something like a cracked crown; but my
wits are whole enough, so the damage can’t be very
great. I can tell better if you will allow me to
rise—which you can safely do, as I assure you
I’m not your enemy, nor was I lying in wait.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell then explained his concealment among the
bracken, relating exactly what he had seen. “I
thought you must have got far away, to judge
from your speed down yonder slope.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, sir,” said the man, stepping back so that
Everell might rise, “I had no need to run further.
I was already off the land of them that were chasing
me—the boundary is just beyond the glade:
you could see the fence among the trees if ’twere
daylight—but I kept running lest they might send
a shot after me. As soon as I found covert on this
side the glade, I stopped to get my breath. Now,
sir, I’ve been as frank with you as you’ve been
with me; and I’m glad to see, by the way you
stand and step, that no lasting injury is done, after
all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell, whose hat had saved his skull, and who
could feel only a little blood, and that already coagulating,
was able to stand without other unpleasant
symptoms than a thumping ache of the head. His
new acquaintance seemed ready to go about his
own business, but Everell was loth to part with him
so soon. He was a short, thick-set, long-armed
fellow, with a broad face, whose bold, rugged features
would by ignorant people be termed ugly,
and whose scowling, defiant look would by the same
people be called wicked. But something in his
speech or manner, or even in his appearance as far
as could be made out in the comparative darkness,
stamped him in Everell’s mind as an honest rascal,
worthy of confidence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No injury, I assure you,” replied Everell. “Indeed
I must thank you for a lesson. Henceforth
I shall look before I leap, in any similar case; with
my hand on my sword, too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis a wise resolve, master. Though I for one
am glad your hand was not on your sword to-night:
for then I should have felt sure you were in league
with them yonder, and worse might have happened.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By ‘them yonder,’ I take it you mean gamekeepers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, sir, Squire Thornby’s men. ’Tis his wood,
yon enclosure. Here on the Foxwell land a fellow
is safe enough, so long as it be only a rabbit or
pheasant now and then. Sure the more fool I for
not thinking of that when you appeared—I might
’a’ known the Foxwell people would never stop
a man them Thornby keepers was down upon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then the shot I heard awhile ago was fired at
you by the Thornby keepers?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No need to speak of that, sir. If so be you
heard a shot, why, you heard it, and there’s an end.”
While he spoke, the man fingered with the flap of
a well-stuffed pocket in his coat. “How I knew
it was the Thornby people was by their voices, sir,
whereby I saw fit to run. Not that I’m afeard of
e’er a body of them all, but I hold it ’ud be fool’s
work to shorten my own life or another man’s.
And right glad I be to know I didn’t shorten your
honour’s, especially now I see what sort of gentleman
your honour is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Twould have been an odd twist of luck indeed,”
returned Everell, good-humouredly. “I am much
in your own case, friend: far from desiring to trip
up another man, I must look to it that I’m not
tripped up myself. My fellow-feeling at present
is with the fox rather than the hounds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then belike you are seeking cover hereabouts?”
inquired the poacher, in a tone of friendly interest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At all events, I wish to remain in this neighbourhood
a few days, without encountering a great
degree of publicity. I say as much to an honest
rogue like yourself—I mightn’t be as free with
a more respectable man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re not far wrong there, sir,” replied the
fellow, not at all displeased, but, on the contrary,
gratified at the justice done him. “I don’t ask to
know anything; I have secrets enough of my own.
But if I can be of any small service, in the way of
information about the lay o’ the land or such a
matter—for I see you’re a stranger hereabouts,
and I know these parts well—better than they know
me, by a great deal—why, then, I’m your servant
to command. But, if not, I’ll bid ye good night
and safe lying wherever you may lodge.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, as for that, I lodge at the ale-house in the
village, for to-night, at least. I told the landlord
I would ride on to-morrow; I shall have to find
some pretext for staying.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, sir, you know your own wishes—but ’tis
not the most private place, that there ale-house, and
they be inquisitive folk, them in the village.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What other lodging would you recommend?”
asked Everell, for the first time seriously awake to
the curiosity that his presence must arouse in so
remote a place. “I certainly desire to go and come
unobserved: I have no mind that my motions should
be watched and discussed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, that’s a question,” said the other, frankly
nonplussed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You ought to know the answer,” said Everell.
“Surely you are able to go and come without witnesses,
when upon such amusements as brought you
out this evening.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Be sure I don’t live at the village ale-house,
master. Nor at any village, neither; nor in sight
of one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where, then, do you live?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have my cottage, and my patch o’ ground that
I contrive to coax a livin’ out of—with a little
assistance from outside.” He scarce consciously
laid his palm against the fat pocket. “’Tis a poor
place, sir, but has the recommendation of privacy.
’Tis so lost in the woods, so to speak, and closed
round by hillocks and thickets, I doubt you could
ever find it if I told you the way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who lives with you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nobody at present, since my last son was took
by the press-gang—he was in Newcastle to visit
his brother, who’s a porter there. They would go
out to see the world, them lads!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you have room for a lodger,” said Everell,
tentatively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fine lodgings for a gentleman like you, sir!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never mind; I’ve had worse,” Everell replied,
thinking of Scotland; “and not so long since,
either.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the food, sir,—with your tender stomach?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Man, I’ve lived two days on a wet oatcake.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The poacher was not the sort of fellow to offer
the same objections over again, nor to be upset by
the novelty of the suggestion. The two being circumstanced
as they were, and intuitively trusting
each other, no proposal could have been more natural.
So far from hemming and hawing, therefore,
the man merely enumerated such further disadvantages
as a gentleman must encounter in sharing
his abode and larder, and, these being made
light of, gave his assent. The question immediately
arose as to how Everell should transfer his residence
from the ale-house to the poacher’s cottage without
leaving a trace. It was important that he should
depart from the ale-house in regular fashion, lest
it be supposed that he had met with foul play, and
a search be made. Moreover, he must have his
belongings—for the cloak-bag contained his clean
linen, stockings, razor, and other necessaries of
decent living: though he desired to be visible to
but one person while in the neighbourhood, he desired
that to her he should appear at no disadvantage.
After some discussion, a course was planned,
which Everell and his intended host—who gave
his name as John Tarby—immediately set out
upon.</p>

<p class='c012'>John Tarby led the way through that part of the
wood which Everell had lately traversed. They
came, at length, to the verge of the glen; but, instead
of keeping to the edge, the guide descended
the bracken-covered side into the deeper gloom of
the thickly timbered bottom. Here, indeed, Everell
found what was to him complete darkness, and he
had to clutch his companion’s coat-skirt for guidance.
John Tarby, however, proceeded without
hesitation or doubt, deviating this way or that to
avoid tree or thicket, the music of the stream rising
or falling as the two men moved more or less close
to its border. At last they emerged from the glen’s
mouth, at the foot of the steep incline that rose to
the old sunken garden of Foxwell Court. Here
John Tarby concealed his gun by laying it across
the boughs of a young oak. Where the glen and
the timber ceased, the walkers were encountered by
the high palings which served to enclose the park
on that side except where wooden bars spanned the
stream. By using the bars as a bridge, Everell and
his guide crossed the stream. Tarby led the way
a few rods farther, stopped, and carefully removed
a loose paling or two. They squeezed themselves
through the opening, and stood in the field. Tarby
replaced the palings in their former apparently
secure position, and then the two rapidly skirted
the field, keeping close to the fence so as to profit
by the dark background it afforded their bodies.
Turning at the angle of the field, and skulking along
a rough stone wall, they finally reached the village
end, meeting their former companion, the stream,
just in time for a momentary greeting ere it passed
under the bridge. Leaving the poacher to lie unseen
in the shadowed corner of the field, Everell
clambered over a wooden barrier and up a low bank,
and, having thus gained the road, went on alone
to the ale-house.</p>

<p class='c012'>The village street was deserted, but the ale-house
windows showed light; and the sound of slow,
broad voices, mingled in chaffing disputation, indicated
that ale was flowing in the general room.
Everell went by way of the passage to his own
chamber, where a lighted candle awaited him. He
rang for the landlord.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve found a conveyance to Burndale to-night,”
said Everell, when the old man appeared. “A belated
carrier, I believe, whom I met at the bridge
yonder, where he’s waiting for me. But as I took
this room for the night, you must allow me to pay
for it, and the price of breakfast, too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The landlord, whose face had lengthened at the
first words, now resumed his serenity, and he amiably
gathered in the silver that Everell had laid on
the table. This seemed to warm him into solicitude
for the departing guest’s convenience, and he expressed
the hope that the wagoner was at the door
to carry the bag.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, he wouldn’t turn back,” said Everell;
“nor could he leave his horses. But ’tis not far
to the bridge.” And he took up the bag to bear it
himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, then, your pardon, sir, I’ll carry it,” interposed
the landlord.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My good man, I wouldn’t think of taking you
from your house and customers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis not far, as you say, sir, and my daughter—”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Everell had gone, and the obliging old fellow
was left to scratch his head and wonder. The
more he wondered, the more reason there seemed
for doing so. He had not heard anything like a
carrier’s wagon pass, as it must have done if it was
now at the bridge and bound for Burndale. It was
strange enough that a carrier’s wagon should travel
that road at such an hour, and stranger still that
it should do so without its custodian stopping for
a cup of good cheer. And the gentleman’s unwillingness
to have his baggage carried!</p>

<p class='c012'>The ale-house keeper was not so old as to have
outlived curiosity. He slipped out, crossed the
green, and stood in the middle of the road, peering
through the starlit night. Yes, there was the figure
of the gentleman, truly enough, swiftly retreating
down the village street that led to the bridge. The
landlord slunk after him, keeping close to the walls
and hedges, and stepping silently. He was soon
sufficiently near the bridge to perceive that no conveyance
waited there. The assurance of this acted
so upon his mind as to make him stop and consider
whether it was safe to go further. As he stood
gaping, the form of the strange gentleman suddenly
vanished. The old man stared for another moment:
then, assailed with a feeling that here was mystery
nothing short of devil’s work, he turned and fled
in a panic to his ale-house.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell, who had not once looked back, had passed
from the old man’s view by turning from the road
to rejoin the waiting poacher. Without a word,
Tarby arose, relieved Everell of the cloak-bag, and
led the way over the route by which they had come
from the park. The palings were again removed
and replaced, the stream was again crossed by means
of the bars. The two entered the blackness of the
glen, Tarby repossessing himself of his fowling-piece.
By the time they had ascended to the general
level of the park, the moon had risen, and, as they
proceeded in a Northwesterly direction, the more
open spaces, whether clothed in green sward or in
bracken of autumnal brown, wore a beauty which
Everell associated in his mind with the young lady
not far away, and thus the silent woods and glades
seemed to him a forest of enchantment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tarby spoke only to call Everell’s attention to
landmarks by which he might know the course again.
He indicated the whereabouts of the keeper’s lodge
without passing near it. They left the park by
means of another such weak place in the barrier as
had served them before, the poacher remarking that
he preferred that kind of egress even when barred
gates were near at hand. They now traversed a
deserted bit of heath, covered with gorse, and
plunged into a rough wood, much thicker and
gloomier than the park behind them. Following
a ditch, or bed of a dried-up stream, they emerged
at last upon some partly clear, rugged land which
rose gradually before them. This they ascended,
and so came to a region of bare, rocky hills and
deep wooded hollows. Tarby kept mainly to the
hollows, until at last, having crossed a little ridge,
he descended to a vale lying in the shape of a crescent,
and seeming in the moonlight to be covered
with timber; but a narrow patch of clearing ran
diagonally across, watered by a little stream. Everell
and his guide came into this clearing at the end
by which the brook left it. Near the stream—so
near, indeed, that they had barely room to walk
between—was a thick mass of tall gorse bushes,
threatening scratches to any intruder. Tarby turned
in among these at a narrow opening, followed close
by his wondering guest. In a moment Everell discovered
that the bushes, instead of constituting a
solid thicket, formed but a hollow circle, within
which was a low cottage of timber and rough plaster.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here us be,” said John Tarby, dropping bag
and gun to respond to the leaping caresses of a
mongrel hound that had sprung up from the door-stone.
“He won’t hurt you, sir; ’tis a ’bedient
animal. When I tells him to stop here, ’tis here
he stops, and won’t come out even to meet me, unless
I call or whistle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The dog transferred his attentions to Everell on
perceiving him to be an approved visitor, while the
poacher opened the door and lighted a candle within.
Entering, Everell found a combination of kitchen,
sleeping-chamber, and living-room, the whole giving
an impression of comfort far exceeding that
of the bothy he had for a time inhabited in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So this is your castle,” said Everell, looking
around with approbation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, sir, with the gorse for wall and the brook
for moat. And I don’t lack a postern to escape by,
if so be I was ever hard pressed in front.” He
opened a small square shutter in the back of the
room. “’Tis all gorse out there, sir, and only
me and the dog knows the path through to the
rocks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was at one end of the room a pallet bed,
which Tarby assigned to his guest, saying he would
shake down some heather for his own use at the
opposite end. He went out, and returned with a
sackful of this, having borrowed from the reserve
supply of his cow, which he housed in a shed on
the other side of the stream. He informed Everell
that he kept a few fowls also, though the great part
of his clearing was made to serve as a vegetable-garden.
He asked what Everell would like for
supper, and named three or four possibilities besides
the rabbit he drew from his large pocket. But Everell
had supped at the ale-house, and, as he was now
quite fatigued, he went to bed, leaving his host to
partake of bread and cheese, while the dog munched
a cold bone in the corner.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Everell awoke, bright day was shining in
through the single window and the open doorway,
and John Tarby was preparing a breakfast of eggs
and bacon. Everell, despite his now eager appetite
and his impatience to be about his purpose,
dressed himself with care, performing his toilet with
the aid of the stream, and putting on fresh linen
and stockings. He then ate heartily, and, having
given his host a sufficient idea of where he wished
to spend his day, set forth in Tarby’s company, that
the poacher might show him the way by daylight.
Taking care to note every landmark, Everell arrived
finally in that portion of the Foxwell park which
lay near the mansion. Tarby here took his leave,
to attend to his own affairs, making a rendezvous
with his guest in case the latter should not have
returned to the cottage by nightfall—for it was not
certain that he could find his way after dark at the
first attempt.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell strolled on till the gables of Foxwell Court
appeared through the trees. He found a convenient
spot where he could sit and observe the terrace that
stretched between the house and the park. His
highest hope was that the young lady would, sooner
or later, come to take the air upon the terrace and
extend her walk into the park.</p>

<p class='c012'>He sat amidst bracken, peering out through countless
small openings among the browning leaves and
stems. A hundred times he changed his position,
and a hundred sighs of impatience escaped him,
before anything occurred to break the monotony of
his watch. And when, toward noon, the great door
of the house opened, and figures in feminine garb
appeared, they proved to be only the two ladies
in whom he was not interested. They sauntered
along the terrace, arm in arm, talking and laughing,
making a graceful picture against the broken balustrade,
or on the wide steps between the moss-covered,
crumbling flower-pots. They were joined
presently by the stouter gentleman, and at last by
the taller. Finally, after a half-hour of mirthful
chatter, the four went indoors again, and left the
terrace empty for another long time of waiting.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the afternoon the same four appeared on horseback
in the lane which served as the bridle-path
from the courtyard side of the house to the park.
Entering the park at some distance from Everett’s
hiding-place, they were soon lost to his view among
the trees. If she should appear now, while they
were absent! As time lengthened, he meditated
going boldly to the house and asking for her. But
he forced himself to patience, only moving to another
watching-place a few yards away. He had scarcely
done so, and resumed his gaze, when he beheld her
standing upon the steps of the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>He sat perfectly still, as if the least alarm might
frighten her away. She advanced slowly down the
terrace, looked West, then East, then into the park.
Would that those inviting shades might lure her!—would
that she might feel and obey the beckoning
of his heart! But she turned and walked to the
Western end of the terrace, and stood for awhile in
admiration of the soft landscape and distant mountains.
Presently he saw her look sharply toward
the park, as if her attention had been suddenly, and
not pleasantly, drawn that way. He heard the riders,
who were doubtless coming back, and would
pass near her in going through the lane. She
turned and moved toward the opposite end of the
terrace—evidently to avoid them. She did not
stop till she was looking on the neglected garden
from the top of the steps descending to it. There
she stood for a few moments, contemplating the
scene; then passed down the steps, disappearing
from view.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell took his resolution: sprang from his place,
and, bending his body forward, dashed through
bracken and behind trees to the glen-side. He
darted along the crest, reached the gate in the wall,
and saw the young lady sauntering amidst the trees
and shrubbery. He glided swiftly forth, and was
on his knee, pressing her hand to his lips, ere she
could do more than utter a low cry of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c012'>The surprise in her face was quickly followed by
pleasure; but consciousness came a moment later,
with a rush of scarlet to her cheeks and a look of
faint reproof and vague apprehension to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good heaven, sir,” she said, in a low voice,
“I never dreamed of seeing you again!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fear nothing,” he replied, in a tone as guarded
as hers; “we cannot be observed here—the shrubbery
is all around us.—I have come to thank you
for the warning you gave me at the inn yesterday.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>To</span> thank me?” she repeated, round-eyed.
“You mean that is what brings you here—to
thank me for such a little thing?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not such a little thing, either,” he replied with
a smile, as he rose; “the saving, perhaps, of my life
and my comrade’s.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, indeed, yes—a very great thing!—but
a little thing to do—so easily done. And to come
all the way hither to thank—” She stopped short
and looked at him steadily, then blushed deeper.
“Oh!—you will think me a fool, sir:—for a
moment I believed exactly what you said; I made
no allowance for compliment; I am inexperienced,
as you can see.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, but upon my honour I spoke the truth,”
he protested in surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you indeed came here only to thank me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To thank you, but not only that. I came to see
and hear you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You mean—nothing else—brought you to this
neighbourhood?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing but you. Had I not met you at the inn
yesterday, I should now be with my friend, far
on the road Southward.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The look of apprehension returned to her face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, heaven, yes!—the danger you are in!
How do you intend to save yourself? Are you
not risking your life by remaining in England?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pray don’t be alarmed on that score: I have
the means of leaving England when the time comes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When the time comes? When will that be?
What is it that delays you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was not prepared with an answer. “Why,—ah—you
must know my friend has some matters
to settle before he leaves;—we are to sail together,
when he is ready.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you should have remained together. Why
did you leave him? If what you said is true, you
have interrupted your flight—to see me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are worthy of a far greater compliment
than that,” said he, as gallantly as the confusion
he felt in her presence allowed him to speak.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if danger came to you through this, how
I should have to reproach myself! Oh, I beg you,
follow your friend: overtake him. Lose no time:
now that you have thanked me, go—go quickly!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And have you the heart to send me away when
I have but just found you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, if your life were not at stake—no, I
mean not that. I ought not to talk with you—I
ought not to stay here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Trembling, she made to retreat, but he gently interposed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay,” he said, very tenderly, “the ‘oughts’
and ‘ought nots’ of custom do not apply to us,
situated as we are. Are you not among people who
make you unhappy? Am I not a man whose life
you have saved, and who would do anything in
the world for you? Can you not trust me as I trust
you? Why then shouldn’t you talk with me?
Tell me, what if my life were not at stake?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have forgot what I was saying.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If my life were not at stake, you would not bid
me go?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How can I tell?—Why shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You were startled to see me here. Did you
not think I might come?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She could have truly answered that she had
been without the slightest expectation of ever seeing
him again. Yet she had permitted her imagination
the indulgence of a vague scene of future meeting,
not far unlike that which was now taking place.
The consciousness of this added to the sweet embarrassment
she felt, and she could only reply, foolishly,
“Why should I have thought so?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell sighed, realizing that, as far as speeches
went, he was not making rapid progress. “At all
events,” said he, rallying his powers of gaiety,
“here I am, and in this neighbourhood I mean to
stay for a time, so ’tis of no use bidding me go—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But are you safe in this neighbourhood?” she
broke in, her eyes forgetting their shyness in searching
his face to see if his confidence was real. “That
man at the inn may have described you to many
people.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will take care none of them see me. I have
a secure hiding-place in the wilderness, and a
friend to supply my wants. I shall be visible to
none but him—and you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To me? How to me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Even as I am at this moment: here, in this
garden. ’Tis evidently a deserted place; the shrubbery
and walls conceal us, and escape is easy to the
glen yonder if we should hear anybody approach.
No one, finding you here alone, would suspect you
had had a visitor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must not risk that discovery,—for your
sake, I must not. I shall be missed in the house,
I’m afraid,—my uncle and his friends have returned.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, don’t go yet. Pray, not yet! I have said
nothing yet, accomplished nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What would you say, then? Speak quickly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A thousand things. I can’t unload my heart of
a sudden at the cry, ‘Stand and deliver!’—you
send my thoughts into confusion. Do not go yet!—’tis
not so much saying what I would, as being
with you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But they will be inquiring for me—my maid
will be seeking. My uncle—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is your uncle so heedful of you that he must
always know where you are?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Far from it. I am nothing to him and his
friends. But if the whim <i>should</i> seize him—if by
any chance they should find me talking with a
stranger—Oh, really, sir, I must go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Again you call me stranger!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, in their eyes you would be a stranger.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But not in yours? Ah, thank you for that
much, at least. You acknowledge me as a friend?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, I suppose—since you declare yourself
so, I must needs believe you. Heaven knows, I have
felt some want of a friend, having none in this
house. Were it otherwise, were this place my
aunt’s, perhaps I should not have stayed a moment
to hear you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must bless my fortune, then, that this house
is not your aunt’s. I can even be glad you are
not among friends here, since that leaves room in
your heart for me. And yet I could slay any who
were lacking in the friendship you had a right to
expect of them. How can they be so, to <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p class='c012'>His gaze had so much ardour that her own eyes
softened in it, and the consequence of that melting
was that he swiftly folded her in his arms and
pressed a kiss obliquely upon her lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now I <i>must</i> go,” she whispered, after a moment,
gently pushing him away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now less than ever, sweet,” he replied, still
clasping her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but I must—sure I beg—Prudence will
be looking for me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her insistence of manner was such that he dared
not hold her longer without feeling guilty of violence.
But he still retained her hand, to say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“And when will you be here again?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know not,” she answered, hurriedly. “How
can I say?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, then, whenever you do come, you will find
me waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no; that will not be safe. I had forgotten
the danger you are in. Do not come here at all—by
daylight.—If you must, why, come after sunset.
They will be at their cards and wine then.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you?—you are sure to be here then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis the safest time. They will think me in my
room—well, I may be here—to-morrow evening—if
nothing prevents.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why not this evening?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. I will really go to my room this evening,
as I did yesterday: they will take it as a matter of
course afterwards. To-morrow evening, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But ’tis so far away: so many hours must
pass till then!” He still detained her hand, though
she was at arm’s length to be gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will have the more time to reconsider—to
resolve upon joining your friend, and not tarrying
here longer at the risk of your life.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What, do you still wish me to go at once?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you should be taken!—if you should have
to meet the fate—oh, I dare not think of it! How
can I wish you to stay, when I think of the danger?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis for me to think of the danger; ’tis for
you only to let me love you—and to meet me here
as often as you will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I shall no doubt be here to-morrow after
sunset. I must take my maid into confidence: she
can keep watch at the terrace steps. Farewell, then!—and
be careful—till to-morrow sunset!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He stepped forward in hope of repeating the kiss,
but she recovered her hand from his grasp and fled
rapidly up the lane of shrubbery. Everell followed,
and saw her ascend the steps, hasten along the
terrace, and disappear without looking back. He
stood and sighed, thinking how short had been the
long-awaited meeting, how tedious would be the
time till the next. But he had the kiss to comfort
his reflections, at least,—the kiss and the compliant
though startled manner in which she had
submitted to it. His heart glowing at this recollection,
he turned his steps to the seclusion of the
glen.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since she would not meet him before the end of
the next day—what an interminable stretch of
empty time the interval appeared!—he knew his
best course was to return at once to John Tarby’s
cottage. But he found it so hard to drag his legs
farther from the Foxwell mansion, that he decided
to remain concealed among the bracken, on the possibility
that she might change her mind and revisit
the garden that evening. In this hope he tarried
till an hour after nightfall, without reward. He
then betook himself reluctantly, with the pangs of
hunger and the sighs of disappointment for company,
to where his road left the park. At that place
Tarby was waiting, and with little speech the two
made their way homeward. Everell took the lead,
that he might test his knowledge of the path; twice
or thrice he had to fall back upon the poacher’s
guidance, but on these occasions he made such note
of landmarks as should assure him of going right
in future.</p>

<p class='c012'>When they arrived at the cot, Everell gave a different
reception to his host’s mention of supper
from that which he had given on the previous night.
Though love had enabled him to go all the day without
food, it did not weaken his appetite now that
supper was to be had. John Tarby proved to be
no mean cook, and the Jacobite officer, the rustic
poacher, and the poacher’s dog partook together of
a hearty though simple meal with manifest enjoyment.
But love, not to be denied its proverbial
effects in all things, asserted its presence by robbing
Everell of some hours of sleep, and by directing
his dreams when at last his eyes did close.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next day was but a repetition of that which
had gone before, save that the love-sick young
gentleman, by taking the forethought to provide
himself with bread and cheese, was able, as he
reclined among the bracken, to pay some observance
to dinner-time when it arrived. At last the slow sun
descended upon the Westward hills. A bit of its rim
still showed over the sky-line, when Everell glided
into the garden, his heart beating faster than ever
it had beat when he was going into battle.</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana did not keep him waiting long. She
came down the steps, with her finger on her lip,
and with the maid Prudence, all excitement, at her
heels. “Oh, lor!” whispered Prudence at first
sight of Everell; “Oh, lor!” again, when, having
taken her station near the steps, she saw Everell
lead her mistress up the lane of shrubbery; and
“Oh, lor!” a third time when the young man, not
yet trusting himself to speech, raised Georgiana’s
hand in his trembling fingers to his lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>And now Everell had to learn that the second
interview in a love-affair does not begin where the
first left off. Whether it is that the ardour of expectation
produces by reaction a chill that mutually
benumbs; or whether each participant, still uncertain
of the other’s heart, awaits some assurance
before again committing his or her own; or whether
it be due to any one or all of a dozen conceivable
causes, the truth is that the second meeting usually
begins with an embarrassment, or shyness, or other
feeling, that seems to put the lovers farther apart
than they were at the outset; and yet under this
the craving for the tokens of love is as strong as ever.
This was now Everell’s experience; he wondered
why Georgiana was perversely cool, and then why
he himself was tongue-tied, powerless to express
what was in his heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>When they had paced the more secluded walks
of the garden some fifteen minutes, speaking of
anything but that which was most in Everell’s mind,
Georgiana suddenly reverted to the question of
his safety. The anxious concern with which she
regarded him served to break the spell he had suffered
under. Making light of his danger, he showed
himself so grateful for her solicitude that a still more
encouraging tenderness appeared in her eyes. With
love in his looks, and in the touch of his hand upon
hers, he burst out with declarations of his happiness
in her company, and of his misery in her
absence. She made no verbal return for these
tributes, but the sweet agitation visible in her face
was enough. He was about to venture a similar embrace
to that of the day before, when they heard
Prudence call, in a low but excited voice, “Oh,
mistress, mistress, we shall be discovered!” Georgiana,
in alarm, whispered to Everell, “Conceal
yourself!—good night!” and fled swiftly to where
the maid was watching. Standing perfectly still,
Everell heard the two women go up the steps, and
soon the sound of their footfalls on the terrace died
out. They had returned to the house, then; what
had caused the maid to give the alarm, he knew
not, for there was no sound to indicate any human
presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Vexed at this abrupt termination of the interview
at the very moment when it seemed about to reward
him, he waited in the hope of Georgiana’s return.
But the hope was vain, and after two or three hours
of diminishing expectancy, he sadly—nay, with
heart-burning, grievous sighing, and clenching of
teeth—resigned himself to the prospect of another
long night and another endless day ere the next
meeting. And indeed there was no certainty of the
meeting even after that vast interval, for no appointment
had been made. But he trusted to her humanity,
if he dared not count upon feelings fully reciprocal
to his own, to bring her to the garden at
the next sunset. If she did not come, he knew not
what rash thing he might do.</p>

<p class='c012'>His reliance upon her compassion was not in
vain. She was prompt in appearance when at last
the long night and the slow day had passed. Taking
pity, perhaps, on his haggard countenance, she
was kind from the outset of their interview. Prudence
attended, as before, but with instructions to
be more certain before crying danger than she had
been on the previous evening, when, as Georgiana
now told Everell, the maid, in the novelty of her
duty, had given the alarm at the mere sound of
laughter in the house—the laughter of Foxwell
and his visitors over their wine and cards.</p>

<p class='c012'>But though this, the third clandestine meeting
of these two young people, was not marred by any
preliminary chill or by any waste of time, it was
soon over. Georgiana herself had set the limit of
half an hour, and, whatever it may have cost her
of inner reluctance, she showed her resolution by
breaking away at the end of that time, silencing her
lover’s protests with a voluntary kiss so swiftly
bestowed that, in his delighted surprise, he let her
slip from his grasp. Again he stood alone in the
garden while the dusk came on. Again that weary
blank of lagging hours faced him, with the promise
of such brief joy to compensate him at the end.
He lingered late in the garden, now reviewing in
his memory the delectable scene of the evening—delectable
but too fleeting!—and now repining at
the conditions under which his love had to subsist.
“Oh, to be with her one whole day—one day as
long as those I pass in waiting for the sunset!”
was the burden of his thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>He stood near the terrace steps, taking his last
look at the house for the night. The lateness of
the hour, the comparative darkness, and perhaps
the petulance of his feelings, made him less than
usually cautious against observation. Suddenly he
heard a patter of feet on the terrace, and the voice
of a maid servant calling, “Puss! puss! come,
puss!—Devil take the cat!” Everell remained
motionless, lest any sound might attract the girl’s
attention. In a moment, a cat appeared at the head
of the steps, glided along the top of the bank, and
plunged amidst the shrubbery of the garden. It had
no sooner disappeared than the girl in chase arrived
at the edge of the terrace, where she stopped and
peered down into the garden, launching imprecations
at the animal that had eluded her. Her eyes fell
upon Everell, and her wrath died upon her lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>She stood gaping as if rendered powerless by
fright, and Everell could think of nothing better
than to continue perfectly still. Wrapped in his
cloak, and with his face turned toward the maid,
he did not move even his eyes, but appeared not to
be aware of her presence. His thought was that
this unlifelike behaviour might cause the rustic
wench to take him for an apparition, or a trick of
her fancy, the more so as the darkness would give
vagueness to his figure. After a few seconds of
this silent confrontation, the maid, uttering a faint
wail of terror, apparently at the back of her mouth,
turned and took to her heels. Everell profited by
her flight to leave the garden instantly, and made
his best speed for John Tarby’s castle. If the girl
told of what she had seen, and brought investigators
to the spot, who could find nothing to verify her
account, they would doubtless believe she had suffered
from a delusion. As she herself, whether
she came to their conclusion or not, was likely to
avoid the place after dark in future, Everell considered
that the garden was not the less safe as a
meeting-place for this occurrence.</p>

<p class='c012'>When he met Georgiana the next evening, he expected
some allusion by her to the incident, as he supposed
the maid servant must have spread the tale
through the household. But Georgiana said nothing
of the matter. She had indeed heard nothing of it,
for the isolation in which she dwelt in the house was
copied by her maid, partly in imitation and partly
because, with her Southern ideas of propriety, Prudence
found herself as much antagonized by the rude
Northern servants of the house as by the affected
London attendants of the visitors. Thus she spent
as much of her time as possible in her mistress’s
apartments, big with the secret entrusted to her
of the clandestine meetings. Being thus on sniffing
terms with her equals in the servants’ hall, and
out of their gossip, she remained in ignorance of the
kitchen-maid’s adventure. From Georgiana’s silence
on the subject, Everell inferred that the occurrence
had created no talk in the house; and he did not
mention it himself, lest Georgiana, in her scruples
as to his safety and her own conduct, might lessen
the frequency of their meetings. His periods of
longing were sufficiently endless, his tastes of joy
sufficiently brief, as they were.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the kitchen-maid’s adventure had not really
gone without circulation. “You never told us your
house was haunted, Foxwell,” said Lady Strange,
meeting her host at the breakfast-table, from which
Georgiana had already gone. Mrs. Winter and
Rashleigh were yet to appear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never knew it—till this moment, at least,”
replied Foxwell, stifling a yawn which owed itself,
perhaps, to the punch or primero of the previous
night. “Though every crumbling old brick-heap
like this has its ghost or so, no doubt. But what
do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My waiting-woman has been telling me of a
strange figure that appeared to your scullery-maid
the other night. In the sunken garden, I believe
it was: a man in a cloak, wearing a sword.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must have been a ghost, indeed,” said Foxwell,
smiling. “There is certainly no such living
man whose appearance in that garden is probable—unless
Rashleigh has taken to mooning outdoors
after bedtime.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not I,” said Rashleigh, who had just entered.
“What are you talking of?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My lady has discovered, through the servants,
that a ghost walks in the sunken garden—a man
in a cloak, with a sword at his side. I say it must
be a ghost indeed, and yet there is this difficulty:
suppose there <i>are</i> ghosts of human beings, what
of the clothes they appear in? What of this ghost’s
cloak and sword?—are they real cloak and sword,
or are they the ghosts of cloak and sword?—and do
inanimate things have ghosts?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, certainly, ghosts always appear in
clothes,” said Lady Strange, quite ignoring the
dilemma, and not entering into Foxwell’s skeptical
mirth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And pray what did the ghost do or say while
the scullery-maid was present?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Merely gazed at her in a strange, supernatural
manner till she ran away. But hadn’t you best
question the maid?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By all means. One ought to be well informed
about the ghosts that haunt one’s house—though
I don’t consider my ancestors did so much for me
that I need care a button if one of them does find
his grave uneasy. I’ll have the girl up for interrogation
after breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But this promise was driven from Foxwell’s mind
just as the time came to perform it. A visitor was
announced, whose name caused him surprise: it
was that of Mr. Thornby.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What should bring him to see me?” said Foxwell,
showing his astonishment to his guests. “’Tis
my lubberly neighbour, of whom I have told you.
He abominates me because I sometimes pit my
powers of speech against his boorish arrogance, and
show him what a bumpkin he is. I thought he was
sworn never to cross my threshold.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ruled by courtesy and curiosity, Foxwell went
immediately to the adjoining drawing-room, where
he found his enemy standing on the hearth, his legs
wide apart, and his burly figure clad in a riding
costume neither well-fitting nor new.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Something</span> confident and overbearing in Thornby’s
look went to Foxwell’s intelligence at once, and
checked for an instant the speech on his lips. But
he quickly recovered his nonchalance, and began
as if he noticed nothing unusual:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good morning, Mr. Thornby. I am much
honoured. Pray be seated, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d as lief stand, sir,” was the blunt answer.
“Much honoured you feel, I dare say!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And why not?” said Foxwell, pleasantly.
“You do yourself a great injustice, surely, if you
don’t consider your visit an honour to the fortunate
recipient. You must not undervalue yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, sir, you’ll see how much honour I mean
by coming here, when you’ve learnt what brings
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That, I confess, I am impatient to know. But
really, will you not sit?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, sir! I sha’n’t stay long enough to tire my
legs with standing. My visit will be short, I promise
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I perceive you are in a mood of shortness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can choose my own moods, sir,” said the
Squire, rendered more savage by every successive
speech of his enemy. “And I choose short moods
for my visits to you. Not that I meant to pay
you a visit when I left home this morning. My
business took me past your gate, and, as I have
something for your ears, I thought I’d as well say it
soon as late.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A very wise thought; for accidents will happen,
and ’twould be a pity if anything so interesting
should be left unsaid—for I know it must be
interesting.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maybe you’ll find it so, ecod! As for leaving
things unsaid, lemme tell you, sir, that’s a policy I
recommend to you in future, whenever you feel
inclined to try your wit upon me. If a witty thing,
as you consider it, comes into your head to say
against me, leave it unsaid. That’s my commands,
sir, and I look to see ’em obeyed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Commands? Upon my soul, Mr. Thornby,—pardon
my smiling,—but you are exceedingly
amusing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Smile your bellyfull; you may laugh, too:
we’ll see which on us laughs last. Ecod, we’ll see
that! Try some of your town wit upon me the
next time we meet in company! Try it, and see
what happens.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can’t you spare my curiosity the suspense by
telling me now?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I can. This is what’ll happen:—I’ll
answer you back by asking what you think of a man
who robs the dead.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Robs the dead?” quietly repeated Foxwell,
puzzled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, a dead body, in some such place as Covent
Garden, for example.—Eh, that touches you,
does it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell’s face had indeed undergone a change:
for an instant he was quite pale and staring. But
he recovered his outward equanimity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please explain yourself,” he said, with composure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A word to the wise is enough, sir. If ever
again you try to put me down afore company, or
dare to take first place o’ me anywheres, I’ll tell the
world who got Lord Hilby’s money that night in
Covent Garden.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell drew a deep breath, and then replied as
calmly as before, “Are you walking in a dream, Mr.
Thornby? Really, I don’t understand you. What
is Lord Hilby’s money to me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No use trying that game upon me, Foxwell.
You know all, and I know all, and there’s an end.
You’ve heard my commands: act as you think
best.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir, I know nothing. Your words are gibberish
to me, and I say but this: if you attempt to raise
any slander against me, be sure I will make you
answer—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I’ll answer, ecod, by producing this here
letter,” blurted Thornby, bringing from his pocket
the document we have already seen in the hands of
Jeremiah Filson, and holding it high, with the signed
part in Foxwell’s view, “which you wrote in the
sponging-house to Sir John Thisleford, and which
anybody who knows your hand can swear to—as
your face owns to it now. ‘If you don’t help me
out of this, I will confess all, and let the world
know who got Lord Hilby’s money that night,’ says
you, in black and white. ‘<i>Confess</i> all,’ d’ye see?
Signed ‘R. Foxwell.’ Your wit failed you that
time, I’m a-thinking. What ’ud the county say if
I exhibited this here bit o’ writing? Even your
town friends, as I hear be a-visiting you, would
find this more nor they could swallow, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me see the letter—closer,” said Foxwell,
in a hushed and quaking voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I value it too much as a bit o’ your beloved
handwritin’.” The Squire repocketed it carefully,
with a grim chuckle at his own humour. “As to
how I shall use it, that depends partly on how you
use me. But I don’t promise anything. I hold it
over your head, neighbour Foxwell,—like the
sword of Dionassius in the story-book—over your
head, ecod! Ha! Good day, Foxwell. Go back
to your pleasures—I’ll show myself out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell made an effort to regain his self-possession.
“’Tis a forgery—I defy you—this is a
trumped-up tale—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We shall see. You’d go near killing to get the
letter from me, I’ll warrant.” With this parting
shot, his heavy features stretched in a leer of
triumph, the Squire stalked from the room, leaving
Foxwell—silent and shaken—to his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c012'>The victorious Squire had to pass through the
wide entrance-hall to reach the forecourt, where his
man Bartholomew awaited with the horses. He
stopped in the hall, which was for the moment
deserted, in order to refold the precious letter and
place it more securely. As he pocketed it once more,
he turned his glance toward the closed door of the
drawing-room, soliloquizing after this fashion, “I’ll
make him play the whipped cur afore I’ve done with
him. He shall come when I call, so he shall,—and
go when I bid, and speak when I allow, and hold
his tongue when I command. You fine beau of the
town, you’ll make a jest of us country gentlemen,
will you?—you’ll teach us manners, will you?—Eh,
who’s this?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The hall was panelled in oak, decorated with heads
of stags and foxes, provided with a large fireplace,
and furnished with chairs and settles. At one side,
the stairway began which led to the upper floors,
and the Squire’s ejaculation was caused by the
appearance of somebody on those stairs—a young
lady, rather slight, but well-shaped, with a very
pretty face distinguished by a somewhat rebellious
expression; and with a pair of eyes that set the
Squire agape with the wonder of a new sensation,
as they rested for an instant full upon him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure I suppose you be the niece that came home
t’other day,” said the Squire, as she stepped from
the lowest stair. He had not relaxed his gaze from
his first sight of her, nor did he now.</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana replied by making a curtsey, and was
about to pass on. But Mr. Thornby, with as great
politeness as he could put into his tone, detained her
as much by an unconscious gesture as by speech.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure I heard tell as Foxwell’s niece had come
home, but I ne’er expected to see <i>such</i> a young lady!
Why, miss, or mistress, begging your pardon if I
make too free, but there bean’t your match in the
county; that there bean’t—I’ll take my oath of
it! I’m your neighbour, Thomas Thornby, at your
service. Mayhap you’ve heard o’ me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have heard your name, Mr. Thornby,” said
Georgiana, looking quite tolerantly upon him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But not heard much good o’ me, if you heard
it from your uncle, I’ll warrant. You mustn’t believe
all he has said against me, Miss Foxwell. ’Tis
like he’ll give a different account o’ me after this:
I’ve just had a talk with him, and he knows me a
little better. Ecod, miss, I hope you and me can be
good neighbours, at all events. Such a face!—excuse
the freedom, mistress, but we don’t run
across such faces every day hereabouts. There’ll
be some, that think themselves beauties, will turn
green when they see you at the assembly ball.
Ecod, we shall have somebody worth a toast now;
for between you and me, the beauties of this neighbourhood
don’t muster enough good looks among
’em all to do credit to the punch we drink their
healths in. At any rate, that’s my opinion, and
explains why I’m still a bachelor. I’m not easy
pleased, ma’am; no doubt I look a plain fellow in
these here old clothes, but anybody’ll tell you how
fastidious Tom Thornby is when it comes to dogs,
horses, and women. ’Tis well known, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am the more obliged for your compliments,
sir; and I wish you good morning,” said Georgiana,
amiably, and, after another curtsey, performed with
unexpected swiftness, she got away by the nearest
door before her new admirer could summon an
idea for another speech.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thornby stared wistfully at the door by which
she had left. Indeed he made a step or two toward
it; but, thinking better, stopped and drew a ponderous
sigh. A servant came into the hall from the
forecourt, whereupon the Squire abruptly took his
departure. As he rode mutely out of the courtyard,
followed by Bartholomew, his countenance betokened
thoughts quite other than those with which he
had left Foxwell’s presence a minute or two earlier.
When he had passed through the village, Thornby
motioned his man to ride beside him, and began
to converse upon Mr. Foxwell and his present habits.
In the course of the talk, it came out, as Bartholomew
had been informed by Caleb while waiting
in the courtyard, that Foxwell and his guests were
accustomed to make some excursion on horseback
every day, leaving the niece at home. The consequence
of this knowledge was that next day, soon
after the party had sallied forth as usual, a servant
came to Miss Foxwell in her own small parlour to
say that Mr. Thornby waited upon her in the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mystified, but desiring not to offend, she went to
him immediately. He was sprucely dressed, beaming,
and all deference. For two hours he sat and
sustained the chief burden of a general conversation
upon everything in the neighbourhood. While
he was more moderate and indirect in his frequent
compliments than he had been on the previous day,
he maintained a steady gaze of admiration, no less
overpowering. Georgiana, wearied to death, had
finally to plead household duties in order to dislodge
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The following day was Sunday, and Miss Foxwell,
making her first appearance at the village
church, found herself again the object of the Squire’s
constant attention, as indeed of the whole congregation’s,
although she divided the latter with the London
ladies. That evening she was discussed at
Thornby Hall by the cronies who happened to be
sharing the Squire’s bachelor table; and such was
the praise uttered by several gay dogs who considered
themselves devilish good judges that Mr.
Thornby was kept secretly alternating between elation
and jealousy. It needed only this approval and
covetousness on the part of others, to complete the
Squire’s sense of the young lady’s surpassing excellence.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the morning, to Bartholomew’s considerable
wonder, Mr. Thornby again discovered business
that took him past Foxwell Court. He had not the
courage against appearing ridiculous, to repeat his
visit so soon, but he rode very slowly in passing the
place, both going and coming; and, welcoming a
pretext for remaining as long as possible in the
near vicinity, he no sooner saw, through the doorway
of the village ale-house, a man who was now a
guest there, than he drew up his horse with alacrity,
saying to his attendant, “The very fellow I desired
to see: we’ll tarry here awhile, Bartholomew.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The man in the ale-house came forth as Mr.
Thornby dismounted, and offered that respectful
greeting which the Squire was so conscious of
deserving and Jeremiah Filson so capable of bestowing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good day, Filson; good day t’ye. I don’t wish
to come indoors: we’ll walk to and fro here on the
green.—I’ve been anxious to see you, Filson, to
know how you’re faring in respect of your Jacobite.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poorly, sir, poorly as yet; though I take it most
kind of your Worship to be concerned upon the
matter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Concerned? In course—why the devil not?
Ain’t I a magistrate? Didn’t I give you the warrant?
D’ye think I dropped the matter there?
I’m as keen upon punishing the rebels as any man
in England. Once you discover where the fellow
is, you’ll see how ready my officers are to help you
take him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Filson was rather surprised at this sudden zeal,
for the Squire, after purchasing the Foxwell letter
and granting the Everell warrant, had not shown a
desire for more of Filson’s society, so that Jeremiah
had been forced to curry favour with the justice’s
clerk, that he might rely upon the ready coöperation
of the legal officers in apprehending the rebel.
But he kept his surprise to himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m quite sure of that, sir. I hope I shall track
the man to his cover, with the aid of Providence. I
hate to give a thing up, sir, once I’ve set myself to
do it. When I start upon a chase, no matter what’s
the game, I can’t leave it unfinished, and that’s
why I still linger here, though at some little expense
to myself. But we act as we’re made; and
I’m made like that, your Worship.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It does you credit, Filson: I like a staying
hound. But are you sure, now, the man is still in
this neighbourhood?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t presume to be sure of anything, sir; but
I trace him to this neighbourhood and no farther.
’Twas on or about this very spot, your honour, that
he was seen by the postilion whom I met that same
night at the inn where I had the honour of first
making your acquaintance. The next day, you’ll
remember, I had the privilege of transacting some
business with your Worship. I came directly from
your house to this, but my gentleman had fled the
night before. He told the landlord a cock-and-bull
story of having found a wagon to take him
on to Burndale. But the landlord spied on him, and
saw no wagon at the place he said it was waiting.
Furthermore, the landlord declares the gentleman
disappeared from sight at that very place. It was
night-time, and the truth must be, that the gentleman
turned aside from the road. Howsoever, that’s
the last account I can get of him—his disappearance
at the bridge yonder. I’ve been to Burndale, but
no such person has been seen there, or between here
and there. Neither is there any trace of his
doubling back over his course. And, besides, if he
was bound for Burndale, or that side of the kingdom,
why should he have come so far by the road I found
him in?—there are shorter ways to Burndale from
Scotland. No, sir, if I may express an opinion to
your Honour, his business must have been in this
neighbourhood, not beyond it; he has found snug
hiding hereabouts, but I’ll have him out yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Trust you for a true terrier, eh, Filson.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir, with your Worship’s approval and the
forces of the law to support me. I failed in vigilance
that day at the inn—allowed the corporeal
desire of sleep to get the better of me, and was
punished by the man slipping through my fingers.
But Providence, after teaching me the lesson, sent
the postilion to hear my belated inquiries, which
I ought never to have postponed to the needs of the
body. The question is, where could my gentleman
have gone when he vanished under the nose of
this old fool—begging your Worship’s pardon—that
night?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s the Foxwell estate begins just beyond
that bridge.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, on one side of the road. And the Dornley
on the other. I’ve quietly seen Mr. Dornley, after
making sure of his loyalty in politics, and furnished
him with a written description of my gentleman.
I’ve hesitated to approach Mr. Foxwell, lest perhaps
you might have told him how you came by that
letter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No fear o’ that; but, if he saw you, he’d soon
enough guess, take my word on’t.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, scarcely, sir, if I may venture to say so.
If you told him that Sir John Thisleford’s former
valet was in the neighbourhood, and if you gave
some notion of my present appearance, then he
might indeed guess. But otherwise I’ll warrant he
wouldn’t know me. You see, sir, we look different
out of livery, and my name wasn’t Filson when I
served Sir John; and in various ways my manners
have altered—for the better, I trust. So if your
Honour has given him no hint of the matter, I think
I may safely go and solicit his interest in my quest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, do as you see fit, man. If he discovers
you, ’tis your back must abide the cudgel, nobody
else’s. Ecod, the letter will serve my purpose just
as well, whether or not he knows how I came by it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jeremiah Filson was not long in availing himself
of the security with which he now felt he might
interview Foxwell. He thanked Providence he had
not been too late to stipulate against the Squire’s
mentioning him in connection with the letter, which
he had neglected to do at the time of their transaction.
The afternoon of that same day saw him
make his very civil and yet not obsequious approach,
the manner of which rather recommended him to
Foxwell, as being unmistakably of London. Learning
that his business was of a private nature, Foxwell
heard him in the drawing-room, where Filson
introduced himself with a careful ambiguity as upon
a business “in the interest of Government.” Foxwell
listened with polite attention to the glib
description of the “fugitive rebel, one Charles
Everell, who was of the Pretender’s body-guard of
gentlemen at Culloden,” and who was suspected of
being now in hiding in the neighbourhood, possibly
upon the Foxwell estate.</p>

<p class='c012'>Filson, being satisfied by his hearer’s unconcerned
manner that Foxwell neither knew nor cared anything
about the Jacobite, explained that, while a
justice’s warrant had been made out, upon his affidavit,
to “take and apprehend” this Charles Everell,
he was prosecuting the search quietly rather than by
such public means as might give the refugee the
alarm. He was, therefore, in this private manner
soliciting the coöperation of the loyal gentlemen in
the neighbourhood, and begging that, in the event
of their discovering such a person, either by chance
or as a result of investigations their loyalty might
prompt, they would cause the man to be detained,
and would send word to him, Jeremiah Filson, at
the ale-house in the village. “For, d’ye see, sir,
I’ve arranged matters that I can put my hand on
the justice officers at short notice. I shall be the
chief witness against the rebel, and I know where
to find another, as two are required. The other, in
fact, is at Carlisle, where the trials are now on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell, not at all interested, went as far as
loyalty ordered, in saying that, if occasion arose for
his services in the matter, he would act as duty
required; and offering the spy the freedom of the
estate in the prosecution of inquiries. Filson, after
a profound bow of acknowledgment, handed Foxwell
a written description of the rebel, calling attention
to his own name and address at the bottom of
the sheet; declared himself the other’s very humble
servant, bowed as low as before, and took his leave.</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell glanced carelessly over the written description,
and then thrust it unfolded into his pocket.
It had not power to drive from his mind the vexatious
subject already lodged there. He frowned
and sighed, and took an impatient turn up and down
the room. Then, forcing his brow to smoothness
and the corners of his mouth to pleasantness, he
returned to his friends on the terrace.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You laughed at me the other day, Foxwell,”
said Lady Strange, as he approached, “for telling
you the place was haunted. But what do you say
now? The ghost has been seen again, in the old
garden yonder; and not only that same ghost—a
man in a cloak—but a female figure as well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Two female figures, the girl said,” corrected
Mrs. Winter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wonderful, most wonderful!” exclaimed Foxwell,
smiling. “And whence comes this news?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The keeper’s daughter has just told us,” said
Rashleigh. “Her sweetheart, it appears, was coming
last night from the village to see her, and took
a short way through the fields into the park. ’Twas
he saw the three figures in the garden; and one of
them, it seems, was like that seen by the scullery-maid
the other evening.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The scullery-maid?” said Foxwell. “I remember:
I promised to question her, but something
put it out of my mind. Well, ’tis not too late:
we’ll catechize her now—and the keeper’s daughter,
too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But the keeper’s daughter had gone home to the
lodge, and the examination was confined to the
kitchen girl, who came to the summons as much
frightened as if she were brought, not to tell of a
ghost, but to face one. Foxwell and his visitors
seated themselves in the hall to hear her story, the
other servants being excluded. By patient interrogation,
Foxwell contrived to elicit an account hardly
more circumstantial than Lady Strange had previously
given him. The girl had pursued the cat
with the intention of employing it against the mice
in the dormitory of the maids. Drawn thus toward
the garden, she had perceived the motionless cloaked
figure, which had stared at her in a strange, death-like
manner. It wore a sword, and she thought that
in life “the gentleman might have been a king’s
officer,” though she could not say what made her
think so.</p>

<p class='c012'>The word “officer” seemed to touch some association
in Foxwell’s mind. His hand went to the
pocket containing the paper Filson had given him,
and he showed a faint increase of interest in the
few answers the girl had yet to make. When he
had dismissed her, he turned smilingly to his
guests:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, we must avail ourselves of this ghost
while it is in the humour of haunting us. Kind fortune
seems to have sent it for your entertainment.
What say you to a ghost-hunt?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How are ghosts usually hunted?” asked Rashleigh;
“with hounds? beagles? terriers?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, that would not do,” said Foxwell, thoughtfully.
“As we know where it appears—for it has
been seen twice in the sunken garden, according to
the evidence—we had best set a trap for it. What
do you think, ladies? It may help enliven the
night for us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should dearly love to see a ghost,” said Lady
Strange; “but what manner of trap would you
use? Sure such an insubstantial thing can’t be
held by any machine of wood and iron.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A trap composed of three or four stout fellows
armed with cudgels,” suggested Foxwell, “would
doubtless serve to hold the creature till Rashleigh
and I could arrive with our swords.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But a ghost is like air, is it not?” said Lady
Strange. “It can’t be caught, or stopped, or even
felt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have always suspected that a ghost that can be
seen can be felt, especially if it wears clothes,” replied
Foxwell. “However it be, here is an opportunity
to settle the question,—if the ghost continues
to haunt the same place. We will set our trap this
evening; if we catch nothing, we’ll try again to-morrow;
and so on, till something occurs, or we
grow tired. We had best tell nobody of our purpose:
the ghost may have accomplices. Pray let none
of the servants know, but the men I employ in the
affair.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He bestirred himself at once in preparations, glad
of having found fresh means, not only of distracting
his own thoughts somewhat from the letter in Squire
Thornby’s possession, but also of blinding his guests
to the disturbance of mind which that matter still
caused him.</p>

<p class='c012'>His plans were simple. Choosing three men
rather for stoutness of heart than for stoutness
of body, though they were not deficient in the
latter respect either, he instructed them to post themselves,
while it was still day, in well-concealed places
at different sides of the garden. Two, the gardener
and the groom, were provided with cudgels, while
the keeper took a fowling-piece, which he was not
to fire except in extreme circumstances. At the
appearance of the ghost in the garden, the keeper
was to utter a signal, whereupon Foxwell and his
guests—who were to pass the evening as usual at
the card-table—would come forth as quietly as
possible, the gentlemen with their swords ready to
enforce the intruder’s surrender. Should the ghost
attempt flight before the gentlemen could arrive,
the three servants were to close round him, using
their weapons only as a last resource, and after due
warning—for the ghost was probably a gentleman,
and Foxwell would have it treated as such. The
three watchers were to go singly to their places of
concealment, entering the garden directly from a
postern in the ruinous eastern wing of the house,
so that nobody outside of the garden itself could see
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And is not the pretty pouting niece to be admitted
to this sport?” asked Rashleigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By no means,” replied Foxwell, with a frown.
“She has elected to keep out of all our amusements,
we can spare her company in this. If the young
prude finds satisfaction in holding aloof, for God’s
sake let her do so. She disapproves of so many
things we do and say, ’tis very like she would disapprove
of this. Threatening a ghost with a cudgel,
egad!—she might take it into her head to play the
spoil-sport—you know the malice of excessive
virtue.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So nothing was spoken of the matter at dinner.
This meal—which occurred at the London hour,
in the late afternoon—was now the only regular
occasion upon which Georgiana joined the company.
For the passing of her days, she had her books, the
care of her wardrobe and apartments, her music,
drawing, embroidery, and walks—for she took
these, though never on the side of the house toward
the park, lest Everell might risk his safety by approaching
her. She still met that gentleman each
evening, at a later hour now than at first; and he
it was that occupied her thoughts all the day, whatever
the employment of her hands and feet. She
acknowledged to herself her love for him, and wondered,
sometimes with hope but oftener with deep
misgiving, what the end would be. At times she
had a poignant sense of the danger he was in by
remaining near her, but she shrank even then from
sending him away, for their separation must be long
and might be eternal. As deeply as he, though less
vehemently, did she lament the circumstances that
compelled them to be secret and brief in their meetings.
She was by no means of that romantic turn
of mind which would have made the affair the more
attractive for being clandestine. People who do
romantic things are not necessarily people of
romantic notions: it is a resolute fidelity to some
cause or purpose, that leads many a generous but
matter-of-fact hero or heroine into romantic situations.
Indeed, is it ever otherwise with your true
hero and your true heroine? Are not the others
but shams, or at best poseurs? Georgiana followed
courageously where love led; but because she really
loved, and not because the conditions were romantic:
she was no Lydia Languish—she would joyfully
have dispensed with the romance.</p>

<p class='c012'>On this particular evening, the conversation at
dinner took a turn which gave it a disquieting significance
to her, though she bore no part in it herself.
Lady Strange had mentioned a certain young
lord as having died because he preferred his love
to his life. Foxwell had politely laughed. Lady
Strange had somewhat offendedly stood by her assertion,
whereupon Foxwell had declared the thing
unknown in nature. Mrs. Winter supported him;
but Rashleigh took his cousin’s side, saying, “What!
no man ever died for love, then? Surely there
have been cases, Bob.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Men have been brought to death by their love-affairs,
I grant you,” said Foxwell, “but that is
because circumstances arose which they had not
foreseen, and from which they could not escape.
They have even risked their lives to prosecute their
amours, but <i>risking</i> one’s life upon fair odds is a
vastly different thing from <i>deliberately offering</i> it
in exchange for the indulgence of one’s love. That
is what my lady’s words really mean: ‘preferring
one’s love to one’s life.’ Such bargains are mentioned
in ancient history—as of the youth who,
being deeply in love with a queen, agreed to be
slain at the end of a certain time if he might pass
that time as her accepted lover. Only such an act
can really be described as giving one’s life for
love; and not the getting killed unintentionally in
some matter incident to a love-affair.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But men have killed themselves at the loss of
the women they loved,” urged Lady Strange.
“There was Romeo, that Garrick plays so beautifully.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis the work of a poet who says in another
place, ‘Men have died from time to time, but not
for love.’ When men kill themselves at the loss of
a woman, you will find they have lost other things
as well—fortune and reputation; or their wits, in
drink.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Lady Strange held that a true lover would
not hesitate to mortgage his life for a season of
love, if the latter could not be obtained by any
means at a lower price. “If he is young, and in
love for the first time,” added Rashleigh. But
Foxwell and Mrs. Winter remained cynical, and the
latter became even derisive, so that the dispute grew
warm on the part of the two ladies, who did not disdain
to colour their remarks with sly personalities.</p>

<p class='c012'>The discussion promised to be endless, and was
still going on when Georgiana left the table. Not
unaffected by the allusions to fatal consequences
arising from dangerous love-affairs, she waited in
her own rooms till dusk, and then, attended by the
faithful Prudence, stole softly down the stairs, and
along the terrace to the sunken garden.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c007'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>SWORDS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>As</span> she passed below the room in which her uncle
and his friends were, she heard their voices, and
observed that one of the windows was open. But
to this she attached no importance, unusual as the
fact was at that hour, for she had other matters
to think of. And indeed the night was not chill,
though a slight breeze was stirring the leaves in the
garden as she entered it. Leaving Prudence at the
foot of the steps, Georgiana swiftly threaded the
different alleys of shrubbery to make sure that no
person chanced to be in the garden, a precaution
she had adopted since the first meetings; but she
did not peer under any of the bushes, or behind
those that grew close to the wall, for she had not
conceived that anybody might come into the garden
to hide, or for other purpose than his own pleasure.
She went and stood in the gateway near the glen-side.
A moment later she saw the dark form of
her lover approaching in the gloom of the park,
and presently his arms were around her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How you tried my patience, sweet!” said he,
leading her slowly toward the midst of the garden.
“You are later than usual. I was beginning to
think you must have appeared already, and that
my eyes were so blurred watching the gateway they
had failed to see you. Two minutes more, and I
should have left my thicket and come to assure
myself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never do that, I beg! Never come into the
garden till you see me in the gateway—not even
though you hear my voice. Promise me you will
not—promise, Everell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I would promise you anything in the world
when you ask with that voice and those eyes—anything
but to cease loving you or to leave you.
But I do believe the goddess of love has this garden
in her keeping, and reserves it wholly for us, we
have been so safe from intrusion in it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have been very rash. I tremble to think
how careless we were at first, when you were wont
to come in before I saw that the coast was clear.
But we are never perfectly safe here—as we found
last night, when that country fellow stared in at
the gateway.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I doubt if the yokel really saw us. But, if so,
he would find nothing strange in your being here
with your maid. If he saw me, he would suppose
I was your uncle or some visitor. But I will take
all precautions, dear, if only to make your mind
easy. I wouldn’t have you suffer the least fear,
not even for the sake of that look of solicitude in
your eyes, which is certainly the tenderest, most
heavenly look that a woman or an angel can bestow.
It goes to my inmost heart, and binds me to you
for ever. And yet I’d have you smile, for all that,
if you’d be happier smiling.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I might be happier smiling, but I think I should
not be as concerned for you then,” replied Georgiana,
simply, and with a smile that had a little sadness
in it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, my dearest!” said Everell, softly, with a
sudden tremor in his voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>The silence that followed might have been longer
but that the young man could not forget, for more
than a few seconds at a time, how brief their interview
was to be. He imagined, perhaps mistakenly,
that the value of such meetings was to be
measured in speeches rather than in silences, although
he attached full worth to eloquent glances.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When I feel how dull the hours are between
these short glimpses of heaven,” said he, “I marvel
to think how tedious the years must have been
before I saw you, though I knew it not.—I never
chafed at danger till now. Sometimes when I lie
in the bracken yonder, or pace the dark bottom of
the glen, I am tempted to ignore all risks, come
boldly to your house, seek the acquaintance of your
uncle, and measure my happiness by hours instead
of minutes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Everell!—do not think of it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, have no fear, sweet. Your commands are
sacred with me—till you command me to leave you,
or not to love you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if I commanded you earnestly to leave?—resolutely,
so that you knew I meant it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Could you have the heart to do that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would that I had! I ought to have. But
would it be useless?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As useless as it would be cruel, sweet, I vow
to you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But ’tis cruel to let you stay. ’Tis a wonder
your presence in the neighbourhood isn’t known
already—a wonder the poacher hasn’t betrayed
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, he is true as steel. We are in the same
galley—both rebels, he against the game laws and
the world’s injustice, I against the present dynasty.
You must know, we outlaws stand together.—You
are again in the mood of fearing for my safety. But
see how baseless your fears have been so far. Trust
our stars, dearest: mine, at least, has ever been
fortunate.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My fears are always returning. Sometimes I
have the most poignant feeling of danger surrounding
us, of reproach to myself that I was the cause
of interrupting your flight. I have that feeling now.
Oh, Everell, loth as I am to send you away, I feel
in my soul that I ought! My heart, which would
keep you here, at the same time urges you to fly:
with one beat it calls to you, ‘Stay,’ and with the
next cries, ‘Go!’ Oh, why did you not go on
with your friend?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, ’tis better he and I are apart, since that
fellow at the inn knew we travelled together,” replied
Everell, trying to reassure her. “If the man
really meant to continue dogging us, our separation
was the best means of confusing him. Dismiss your
fears, sweet. If your regard for me were love
rather than compassion,—love such as I have for
you,—the only impulse of your heart would be to
keep me with you: beyond that, you would not
think, either with hope or fear. And yet your compassion,
so angelic,—nay, so womanly,—I would
rather have than the love of any other woman.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He said this honestly; for she had never in plain
terms owned to him that she loved him, and he, in
the humility of a man’s first love, saw himself unworthy
of her by as much as he adored her, and
therefore did not imagine himself capable of eliciting
from her what he felt for her. Her indulgence he
ascribed to the pity of a gentle heart for one whose
situation, both as a refugee and as a lover, pleaded
for him while his courtesy and honour gave assurance
that her tenderness was safe from betrayal. If
her heart desired him to stay near her, he supposed,
’twas because it hesitated to put him to the unhappiness
of leaving her. That she might suffer on her
own account in his absence, did not occur to him:
she herself was all loveliness, and where she was,
there would all loveliness be; what was he that she
should find him necessary to make the world complete?
Were his presence needful to her content,
she would not limit their meetings to so few moments
in a long day. Thus he thought, or, rather,
thus he felt without analyzing the feeling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis the duty of my compassion, then,” she
answered, “to drive you away. I am more convinced
of it now than ever. Such foreboding, such
misgiving!—why do I feel so? I pray Heaven
’tis not yet too late.—Hark! what was that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis only the master and his guests a-laughing
over their dissipations,” said Prudence, near whom
the lovers happened at the moment to be standing.
“They’ve left the window open, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“See how easily you are frightened without
cause,” said Everell. “Come, has not the mood
run its course?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Blame me not that I bid you go, Everell!” she
replied, as if not to be reassured. “You may come
to blame me that I ever stayed to hear you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“For that dear fault my heart will thank you
while it moves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It <i>was</i> a fault!—I see now that it was. I
was so solitary, so rebellious against my uncle and
his company, that when you came my heart seemed
to know you as a friend; and I listened to you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, sweet listener that you were! What effect
your listening had upon me! I had wished to return
to France, which in exile I had grown up to
love. This England, though I was born in it, was
to me a strange country, but you have made it
home!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He raised both her hands to his lips, while she
stood irresolute, her eyes searching his face for the
secret of his confidence, which she would have rejoiced
to think better warranted than her fears. The
silence was suddenly broken by a slight, brief noise
in the greenery near the steps.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s that?” she said, quickly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The wind,” replied Everell; but the sudden
straightening of his body, and fixity of his attention
upon the place of the sound, betrayed his doubt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” whispered Georgiana, “’twas quite different.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some animal moving among the shrubs,” said
Everell. “I’ll go and see.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With his hand upon his sword-hilt, he walked
to the shrubbery growing along the foot of the
bank which rose to the terrace. “’Twas hereabouts,”
he said, and, drawing his weapon, thrust
it downward into the thick leafy mass. From the
further side of the mass came the loud hoot of an
owl, followed by the noise of a man scrambling to
his feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah! come out, spy!” cried Everell, as the
human character of the intruder was certified by a
sound of husky breathing.</p>

<p class='c012'>He darted his weapon swiftly here and there
through the shrubbery, and then ran seeking the
nearest opening by which he might get to the enemy.
But the enemy spared him that trouble by appearing
on the hither side of the barrier, from the very
opening that Everell had sought. The strange man
had a gun raised, to wield it as a club.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell, recalling his experience of John Tarby’s
fowling-piece, nevertheless ran toward the fellow,
hoping to dodge the blow, and disable the man by
pinking him in the arm or shoulder, after which it
might be possible to learn his purpose and come to
terms. But just as the young gentleman went to
meet his approaching foe, a sharp scream from
Georgiana distracted him, so that, though he saved
his head, he caught the gun-stroke on his right
shoulder, and his sword-thrust passed wide of his
adversary. He now heard other feet hastening
toward him through the garden: it was, indeed,
the appearance of the two other men, coming to the
keeper’s aid upon his signal of the owl’s hoot, that
had caused Georgiana to cry out. Everell, seeing
his first opponent draw back to recover himself,
turned swiftly to consider the newcomers, placing
his back to the high shrubbery. One was approaching
on his front, the other at his left. They both
brandished cudgels; but, as they saw him dart his
glance upon them in turn and hold his sword ready
for a lunge in either direction, they stopped at safe
distance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Everell, fly!” cried Georgiana, hastening
to his side.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What! and leave you to these rascals, sweet?”
he answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They’ll not harm me: they are servants here.
Save yourself!—for <i>my</i> sake!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked at her for an instant, read in her eyes
the pleading of her heart, and said, softly, “For
yours, yes!—we shall meet again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He then started toward the gateway leading to
the park and glen. But the gardener and the groom
swallowed their fear of steel, and made bravely to
intercept him. He had confidence in his ability with
the sword to deal with two men armed with cudgels.
But he knew that his ultimate situation would be
so much the worse if he killed either of these fellows.
His thought, therefore, was to elude them
by mere fleetness, or slightly to disable them. He
soon abandoned the former hope, for at the first
turn he tried they were swift to head him off. So
he charged straight at the nearer, thrusting so fortunately
as to prick the fellow’s shoulder, making
him lower his cudgel with a howl. Everell now
tried a similar lunge at the other cudgel-man, but
the latter divined his purpose, and saved himself
by tumbling over backward. The wounded man
had instantly transferred his cudgel to his left hand,
and now stood again in Everell’s way, while the
fellow with the gun had come up to threaten him
in the rear. Informed of this last danger by his
hearing, the Jacobite sprang aside to the right in
time to avoid a second blow. He turned swiftly
upon the gun-wielder, whose fear of the sword
made him thereupon flee toward the gateway.
Everell’s three adversaries were now all in that part
of the garden through which he had intended to
escape.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This way!” cried Georgiana, from behind him;
“and by the terrace!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell wheeled around and made a dash for the
steps. His enemies were prompt to recover from
their surprise and rush after him, the fallen man
having speedily got on his feet again. But the
clean-limbed Jacobite won to the steps by more
than striking-distance. He thought to clear them
in two bounds, then cross the terrace and gain the
park.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eh! the deuce!” exclaimed a voice at the head
of the steps, as a dark form, backed by several
others, appeared there. Everell, who had just set
his foot on the middle step, checked himself at the
risk of his balance, and leaped back. The newcomer,
who had a sword in his hand, thrust downward at
Everell, at the same time calling out, “The light,
Caleb!”</p>

<p class='c012'>A lantern, which had been concealed under the
coat of its bearer, now cast its rays over the scene
from one side of the stair-top. Its help was more
to those who arrived with it than to Everell, whose
eyes had become used to the light shed by the stars
alone. But he was now enabled to make sure that
his new intercepter was Mr. Foxwell himself; that
Rashleigh was at that gentleman’s side, with drawn
sword; that the two London ladies stood close behind,
peering forward and yet shrinking back, as
curiosity disputed with fright; and that the man
servant with the lantern carried also a coil of rope.
All this was the observation of an instant. Even
as he made it, Everell put his sword at guard, and
looked a questioning defiance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A sturdy ghost, as I live!” cried Foxwell, motioning
the three fellows at Everell’s back, who had
come to a halt at the first intimation of their master’s
arrival, to stay their hands. “My niece, too!—the
guileless Georgiana!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Uncle!” she began, scarce able to speak, though
her pale face and terrified eyes were eloquent
enough; “this gentleman—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is my prisoner, till he gives an account of himself.
Do you surrender, sir?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, sir,” replied Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I must reluctantly order these men to
take you,” said Foxwell, politely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then their deaths be on your head,” said
Everell, and turned to make another dash for the
gateway, determined this time to spare none who
barred the way. To this direction of escape he was
limited by his unwillingness to try fatal conclusions
with Georgiana’s kinsman. But he was robbed of
choice in the matter; for no sooner had he taken
two strides than Foxwell, afraid of losing him,
leaped down the steps, and shouted, “Turn and
defend yourself!”</p>

<div id='i195'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i195.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“THE TWO GENTLEMEN MADE THEIR SWORDS RING.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Fearing that non-compliance might result in the
indignity of being struck on the back with the sword
while in flight, Everell obeyed. Ere he could think,
his blade had crossed that of Foxwell, who a second
time bade the three underlings hold off. The two
gentlemen made their swords ring swiftly, in that
part of the garden near the steps, Caleb moving
the lantern so as to keep its light upon them.
Georgiana watched in fearful silence, Prudence
clinging to her and recurrently moaning, “Oh,
lor!” Rashleigh stood on the steps, ready to interfere
at call. The combatants seemed admirably
matched, and each had reason to admire the other’s
fencing. But, to Everell’s relief, it presently became
apparent that the elder man’s arm was weakening.
The Jacobite now indulged the hope of
disarming him. But Foxwell, too, saw that possibility.
He beckoned Rashleigh, who thereupon ran
forward and struck up Everell’s sword, while the
groom and the gardener, obeying a swift command
of their master, seized the Jacobite’s elbows from
behind. Everell made a violent effort to throw
them off, but in sheer strength he was no match
for them. Relinquishing the attempt, he said,
quietly, to Foxwell, “’Twas scarcely fair.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“For that I beg your pardon,” replied Foxwell,
still panting for breath. “In a matter between us
two alone as gentlemen, ’twould be dastardly. But
I had to take you at all cost. You would not surrender;
though you certainly owe me an explanation
on one score, and are an object of suspicion
on another.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Everell!” murmured Georgiana, who had
fallen to weeping, and was heedful only of her
lover’s plight and not at all of her uncle’s words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everell, say you? Bring the lantern here,
Caleb.” In the better light, Foxwell scrutinized
his prisoner’s face. “The scar on the cheek, too.
’Tis as I thought. But how Miss Foxwell happens
to participate—well, there will be time for explanations.
Sir, if you will give me your <i>parole d’honneur</i>,
I need not inflict upon you the restraint of—”
He indicated the cords in Caleb’s possession.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thank you, but I prefer to retain my right
of escape.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In that case, you will admit the necessity of
the precautions I reluctantly take.” And Foxwell
set about directing the servants in fastening the
captive’s wrists behind him, and in tying his ankles
so as to limit the length of his steps. With a
courteous “Allow me, sir,” Foxwell disengaged the
sword from Everell’s fingers and returned it to
its own scabbard, which Everell had retained at his
side. This act of grace the Jacobite acknowledged
with a bow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Uncle, you will not detain this gentleman?”
entreated Georgiana, conquering her tears. “He
has done you no offence. As to our meeting here,
I will tell you all; the fault is mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not so!” said Everell, quickly. “If there be
any fault in that, ’tis mine. Sir, it was not by
Miss Foxwell’s desire that I came here; it was
against her will that I spoke to her. My presence
was forced upon her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well, you shall be heard presently. You
have a more serious charge to face than making love
clandestinely to young ladies.—As for you, Georgiana,
I thought you were in your chamber, wrapped
in the sleep of innocence. I’ll never trust prudery
again. I beg you will go in immediately,
miss.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Uncle, I will not go till you have set this gentleman
free. You shall have all my gratitude and
obedience: I’ll give you no cause of complaint. Be
kind—generous—I pray—” Her voice failing
her, she fell upon her knees, and essayed to take
Foxwell’s hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, sweet, you go too far,” said Everell, tenderly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Too far, indeed,” said Foxwell. “No scenes
of supplication, I beg,—they are sure to make me
more severe. I advise you to go to your chamber,
miss. You had best oblige me in this, else stubbornness
on your part may awaken stubbornness on
mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go, dear, and trust all to me,” counseled Everell,
who had been regarding her with eyes in which
there was no attempt to belie his love. “Go—this
is not the end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She looked at him a moment; then turned sorrowfully
away, and went slowly up the steps and to
the house, followed by her maid, to whose proffers
of assistance she gave no more heed than if she
had been walking in a dream.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir,” said Everell, with a slight huskiness of
voice, “let me assure you that I am a gentleman
and a man of honour; and that I respect your niece,
and have every reason to respect her, as I would
a saint.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No assurance is needful to convince me you are
a gentleman,” replied Foxwell. “I will lodge you
in a manner as nearly befitting your quality as security
and my poor means will allow. I must be
your jailer for to-night, at least.—Caleb, go before
with the lantern. To the hall first. And slowly.—I
trust you can make shift to walk, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Placing the gardener and the groom at either side
of the prisoner, and the keeper at his rear, Foxwell
set the party in motion. The two gentlemen, following
close, gave their arms to the ladies upon
reaching the head of the steps, and the procession
went on at the slow pace which Everell’s ankle-cords
made imperative.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A mighty pretty fellow, whatever he may be,”
said Lady Strange, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Georgiana is to be envied,” said Mrs. Winter.
“Such are the rewards of virtue.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is vastly in love with her,” declared Lady
Strange. “Did you ever see such tender glances?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis the kind of ghost you could find it in your
heart to be haunted by, is it not, Di?” queried Mrs.
Winter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The keeper must have been in some doubt
whether the ghost <i>was</i> the ghost,” put in Rashleigh,
“before he decided to give the alarm.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There had indeed been indecision on the part of
the keeper, but upon other ground than Rashleigh
mentioned. As he sat with the gardener over their
extra beer later that night, the keeper explained to
his comrade:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I were in a powerful state o’ uncertainty, and
that’s the truth of it. For, in course, I knowed the
young mistress and her maid as soon as ever they
come into the garden. And when this here young
captain,—for I take it, he can’t be no less, what with
the air he have, and the way he handle his sword,—so
when the young captain appeared, I soon see
how the land lay. Though I couldn’t make out
what they was a-sayin’, I could tell it were a matter
o’ clandestine love. Now I were to give a owl’s
hoot when the ghost appeared. Thinks I, ‘Devil a
ghost this is, but yet ’tis the only ghost we’re like
to behold. If I wait for a real ghost,’ thinks I,
‘we sha’n’t get to our beds this night; and yet I
haven’t the heart to spoil the young lady’s love-affair.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And small blame to you, David,” said Andrew
the gardener. “Your thoughts was my thoughts,
and I kep’ a-wondering to myself, ‘What will David
do? If he doesn’t hoot, we shall have to stay out
here all night, and then only get credit for going
asleep and seeing nothing. And yet, if he does hoot,
there’ll be a pretty kettle o’ fish for the young
lady.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Andrew, it were a great responsibility. I
wished it had been left to you to do the hootin’,
for, thinks I, ‘Andrew’s a wiser man than me, and
he’d know the right thing.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maybe so, David, but not such a good hooter,”
said Andrew, modestly. “I’ll admit I did a’most
make up my mind that such kind of love-affairs
comes to no good, and the master ought to know,
so the best thing for all of us would be for you
to consider the stranger a ghost, and hoot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No doubt, no doubt, Andrew, now that I hear
you say so. But I couldn’t muster up the heart,
because I done my own love-makin’ in a clandestine
manner, in my lovin’ days, and I had a sort o’ fellow-feelin’
with these young people, as you might
say. So I couldn’t make up my mind. But I happened
to move my leg, which were powerful cramped
with sittin’ long in one position, an’ I made more
noise nor I bargained for. And the first thing I
knew, the young gentleman were a-proddin’ at me
through the shrub’ry. So before I ever thought,
the hoot come out, more as if there was a owl
inside o’ me which hooted of its own accord, than
if it was of my own free will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It wasn’t of your own free will, man. Take
my word for it, the matter was took out o’ your
hands altogether. The moving of your leg was
ordered from above, to bring about the end that was
predestinated.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe it were, Andrew. At all events, once
the hoot was out, the fat was in the fire. It weren’t
a bad hoot, though, were it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Better nor a real owl could do, David,” said
Andrew, raising his beer to his mouth.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> conversation just related took place in a passage
where the two men kept watch outside the
room in which Everell was temporarily confined. It
was a small chamber with an iron-barred window,
and the Jacobite sat gazing into the flame of a
candle on the mantelpiece, while his fate was being
discussed in the drawing-room. He was still under
the restraint of the cords, which, like that of lock
and key, was warranted by his persistent refusal to
give his word that he would not escape. The master
of the house had personally seen, however, that
the prisoner’s surroundings were made as endurable
as the necessities of the case allowed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So this,” said Foxwell, as he then rejoined his
guests in the drawing-room, “is what lay behind
our Georgiana’s prudery. How the deuce could she
have met the Jacobite?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The question is,” said Rashleigh, “what the
deuce are you going to do with the Jacobite?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish I knew,” replied Foxwell, looking at the
document presented to him by Jeremiah Filson.
“’Tis clear enough what our duty is, as loyal subjects,
and so forth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Twere a pity such a lovable fellow should be
thrown to the hangman,” said Mrs. Winter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A thousand pities,” said Lady Strange. “And
so loving a fellow, too! If ever a man had a true
lover’s look!—well, to be sure, the little Georgiana
is a pretty thing, but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the young blade might look higher if he
had better taste—is that what you were thinking,
Diana?” asked Mrs. Winter, with ironical artlessness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No such thing, neither!” said Lady Strange,
indignantly. “I admire him for his constancy—for
I warrant he is constant to her, and will be
constant to her; and I wouldn’t have him else, not
for the world. Thank Heaven, I am above envy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A slight emphasis upon the I—so slight as scarce
to seem intended—was perhaps what drew from
the other lady the answer:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be too sure of the young fellow’s constancy.
You know, Diana dear, you always have
been somewhat credulous of men’s constancy—’tis
your own fidelity makes you trustful, of course.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Doubt as much as you like, Isabella: we are all
aware you have particular reasons to complain of
men’s fickleness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Feeling that the preservation of the peace required
an immediate diversion, Rashleigh broke in with the
first remark that occurred to him as appropriate:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly this young man is a lover who has
risked his life for the sake of love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, and that proves you and I were right at
dinner, Cousin Rashleigh!” cried Lady Strange.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hardly so, my lady,” said Foxwell. “This
young gentleman merely <i>risked</i> his life in coming
to meet his beloved. He by no means counted
surely upon losing it: his active endeavours to escape
prove that. Mrs. Winter’s contention, which
I supported, was that no man would deliberately
give his life for the sake of love—by which I mean
the passion of love, itself, apart from pity or duty
or other consideration. Now, had this gentleman
come to meet his beloved, knowing certainly that
death awaited him in consequence, then indeed he
would have proved your assertion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, and how do you know he wouldn’t have
done so, if the circumstances had required?” asked
Lady Strange. “For my part, I believe he would.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Provided, of course,” added Rashleigh, “that
by failing to meet her he might lose her for all
time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is implied, certainly,” said Foxwell. “The
alternative we are imagining is: Death for love
gratified—life for love renounced.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Catch a fellow of his years and looks choosing
death on any such terms, if the choice were offered
him,” said Mrs. Winter, derisively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis precisely his youth that would make him
give all for love,” said Rashleigh; “the more so
if this be his first serious love.—But what <i>is</i> to be
his fate, Bob? If you hand him over to the authorities,
he will certainly be hanged, unless that paper
lies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Egad, I was just thinking,” replied Foxwell,
with the faint smile that comes with a piquant idea;
“an Italian duke, a century or two ago, would have
amused his visitors, and settled the point of our
dispute, by putting this young gentleman to the test.
I must say, experiments upon the human passions
have an interest, though the loggish minds of our
countrymen don’t often rise to such refinements of
curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see nothing in it to balk at,” said Rashleigh.
“At the worst, the young man can but die, as he
must if you do your plain duty as a loyal subject.
’Twould really be giving him a chance for his life.
It seems an excellent way out of your own indecision
as to what you should do with him: you
transfer his fate from your will to his.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe he does love the girl,” said Foxwell,
revolving the notion in his mind. “And certainly
his life is in my power—we may let him go if we
choose, and the government be none the wiser, or
we may dutifully hand him over to the law. We
can offer him, on the one hand, his life and freedom
if he will give up his love upon the instant and
for ever, not to set eyes upon the girl again: on
the other hand, a brief period of grace, which he
may pass with her on the footing of a favoured
suitor, on condition of handing him over to the
authorities at the end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And if he decline to choose?” asked Rashleigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I can send word straightway to Jeremiah
Filson to fetch the officers. In that event, young
Troilus will lose both life and love. Either choice
will be a gain upon that.—But you may save your
pity, Lady Strange: he will choose to live and go
free, depend on it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will not depend on it. He will obey the
dictates of his love, and choose death rather than
never see her again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, I shall not be surprised if he does so,”
said Rashleigh. “You take too little account of his
youth, Bob. When men are of his age, and of an
ardent nature, their love shuts out everything else
from their view. ’Tis their universe. Beyond it,
or apart from it, there’s nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fudge and nonsense!” exclaimed Mrs. Winter.
“He will prefer to run away and live to love another
day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We shall see,” cried Lady Strange, “if Bob
will really put it to the test. I’m so sure of the
man, I’ll lay five guineas he will choose love and
death.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, my lady, I’ll take your wager,” said
Foxwell. “Your five guineas will be a cheap price
for the lesson, that we men are not such devoted
creatures as you do us the honour to suppose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never fear my doing <i>you</i> that honour, Foxwell.
But thank you for taking the wager. I’m
dying of curiosity to see how the young fellow will
receive the proposal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is no need you should linger in suspense,”
replied Foxwell, pulling the bell. “Let us have the
matter out now, while we’re in the humour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking up his sword, for use only in case of some
desperate attempt on the prisoner’s part, Foxwell
stationed himself at the door of the room, whence
he could see across the hall and up the passage to
the place of confinement. He then sent Caleb to
request, in terms of great politeness, Mr. Everell’s
company in the drawing-room, whither he was to
be attended, of course, by the two men now guarding
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>While Caleb was upon this errand, it was possible
for Foxwell both to keep eyes on the passage
and to talk with his friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you bet five guineas against me, too,
Bob?” asked Rashleigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, I’ll do that,” put in Mrs. Winter, quickly,
“and five more, if you like.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Done—ten guineas,” said Rashleigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good!” cried Mrs. Winter. “I believe I know
how far a man is capable of going for love’s sake—even
when young and of an ardent nature.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“For all your talk,” answered Rashleigh, with
barefaced affability, “you’ll not make me believe
you’ve never found a man who would face death
for love of you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I may have found some who said they would,”
replied Mrs. Winter, complacently swallowing the
flattery despite all her sophistication, “but that’s a
different thing. Let us see how this Romeo comes
out of the test.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How are you going to put the matter to him,
Foxwell?” asked Lady Strange.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Leave it to me,” was the reply. “Either he
shall go free and never see her again, or he shall be
our guest here for a stipulated time, and then be
given up. The only question is, how long shall that
time be?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A day,” suggested Mrs. Winter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cruel!—a month,” said Lady Strange.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot have him on my hands so long,” said
Foxwell. “Say a week. Shall the wagers stand,
on that condition?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rashleigh made no objection, and the two ladies
were brought to a hasty acceptance of the compromise
by Foxwell placing his finger on his lip
in warning of the prisoner’s approach.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell came as rapidly as the restraint upon his
motions would allow; and stopped as soon as he
had entered the room, to avoid proceeding farther
with his shuffling steps before the company. Foxwell
had a chair placed for him. Caleb and the
two other men were ordered to stand ready outside
the door, which was then closed. Foxwell sat
down near the ladies and Rashleigh, so that the
Jacobite now found himself confronted by four pairs
of eyes, which paid him the compliment of a well-bred
regard vastly different in its effect from the
rude stare of the vulgar. His own glance had
swiftly informed him that Georgiana was not
present.</p>

<p class='c012'>He sat with undissembled curiosity as to what
this interview might unfold. He had obeyed the
summons with alacrity, eager to be informed of
what was to come. He was neither defiant nor
crushed; exhibited neither sullenness nor bravado.
In the solitude of his place of detention, he had
been tormented with the reproach of having brought
trouble upon Georgiana; and he had been sobered
and humbled by the knowledge that at last his
rashness had laid him by the heels. What could
he say to Roughwood now, if that wise friend were
there to see the fulfilment of his warnings? But
these feelings did not banish hope. Everell’s nature
was still buoyant. He was, at least, under the
same roof with Georgiana. Death seemed far away:
he scarcely thought of it as the natural sequel to
his situation. He now looked with frank inquiry
at the face of his principal captor for enlightenment
as to what was intended concerning him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir, I have solicited this meeting,” began Foxwell,
“in order to discuss our positions—yours
and my own. My friends were witnesses to the
occurrence by which you fell into my—that is to
say, by which you became my guest. They know
why I felt bound to detain you, and they will share
my confidence to the end of the affair. It would,
of course, be their right—perhaps their duty as
loyal subjects—to act independently in the interests
of Government, if I chose not to act so. But they
have agreed to abide by my course, whatever that
shall be. So it is well, I think, that they should be
present at this interview.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am far from making the least objection, sir,”
said Everell, bowing to the ladies and regarding the
whole company with an amiable though expectant
composure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are aware, of course,” Foxwell continued,
“of what will follow if I give you up to the nearest
justice. Perhaps you may not know that one
Jeremiah Filson is actively concerning himself about
you in this neighbourhood on behalf of the Government.
He has caused a warrant to be issued against
you, he is circulating descriptions which show him
to be an accurate and thorough observer.” Foxwell
put his hand upon the paper which Rashleigh had
laid on the table. “He waits only for news of your
whereabouts, to bring the constables upon you. He
will be one of the witnesses against you, and the
other, I believe, is now at York or Carlisle—I
know not which, but the judges have been trying
and sentencing your unlucky comrades by the score,
gentlemen as well as the lower orders.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As Foxwell paused, Everell, for want of knowing
what better reply to make, answered in a half-smiling
manner, though his heart was beating rather
faster than usual:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir, I have nothing to say to this—except that
’tis a pity so many poor fellows should die for being
on the losing side. Nor do I own that I am the
man you think.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Too many circumstances leave me no doubt on
that point, sir,” said Foxwell, with a serenity which
showed the hopelessness of any contest on the
ground of identity. “’Tis in your power and right
certainly to deny and temporize; but, if you choose
to tire me by those methods, I have only to deliver
you up at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was something in the speaker’s quiet voice
and cold eyes that gave the whole possibility—trial,
sentence, the end—a reality and nearness it had
never had in Everell’s mind before. He was startled
into a gravity he had not previously felt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” Foxwell went on, “if you choose that we
shall understand each other, there is a chance for
your life—a condition upon which you may have
immediate liberty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell looked frankly grateful. The form of
death assigned to traitors and rebels, with its dismal
preliminaries and circumstances, had not allured
him the brief while he had contemplated it. It
wore a vastly different aspect from that of a glorious
end in the self-forgetfulness of battle. “Immediate
liberty?” he repeated, with some eagerness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“With my warranty,” continued Foxwell, “that
neither my friends, nor myself, nor my servants
shall pursue you, or give information against you,
or in any manner hinder your departure from this
country—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir,” Everell broke in, “I should be an ingrate
not to be moved by such generosity—you are
worthy to be her kinsman!—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Upon the single condition—” went on Foxwell,
without any change of manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, yes; conditions are but reasonable,” said
Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The single condition,” said Foxwell, “that you
will never again, during the whole length of your
life, see or communicate with my niece:—and for
this you will give me your word of honour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never—see her—again?” said Everell,
faintly, gazing at Foxwell as if unsure of having
heard aright.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Upon your word of honour,” replied Foxwell,
who did not alter either his attitude of easy grace
nor his tone of courteous nonchalance during the
interview; “but, indeed, as a part of the condition,
you will leave this neighbourhood at once. That
will be for the comfort of all of us concerned, as
well as for your own safety. If, after twenty-four
hours, you are seen hereabouts, or in this county,
I shall be freed of my obligation: in that event,
beware of Jeremiah Filson and the justice’s men.
And, in the meantime, my niece will be inaccessible.
I will make it my care to see that she is soon married,
so there will be no hope for you in that quarter.
But as the old ballad says that love will find
out the way,—though I greatly doubt the possibility
in this case,—I must, nevertheless, make
doubly sure by requiring, as I have said, your word
of honour that you will never of your own intention
see or address her, directly or indirectly, in this
world. That is all, I think.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is too much that you ask!” cried Everell.
“Your condition is too hard—I can’t accept it—no,
sir, I cannot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yet if I hand you over to the law straightway,”
said Foxwell, quietly, “you will not see her
again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There will still be the possibility of escape,” replied
Everell; “there will be no binding word of
honour. But go free without <i>one</i> hope of ever
meeting her again?—no, make the condition something
else, I beg you, sir; or hand me over to the
law, and let me retain my right of escape.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Lady Strange’s eyes shone with applause, but
Rashleigh and Mrs. Winter waited for the scene to
continue. After a moment’s silence, Foxwell began
anew:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, sir, I must congratulate my niece upon
your devotion. Rather than give her up for ever,
you will risk death. You hazard all upon your
chance of escape. ’Tis a slight chance enough: that
you will own.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No doubt,” replied Everell, in a faltering voice;
“but ’tis something.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Suppose it fails you. Then, in losing your life,
you lose the lady, too. Your chance of seeing her
again is even smaller than the small chance of your
escape: you may be sure that special precautions
will be taken with you—such that your chance will
be hardly worth calling by that name.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell sighed deeply, and it is no use denying
that he looked plaintive and miserable.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what if I propose an alternative?” said
Foxwell. “What if I offer to make you our guest
here—for a week—as free as any other guest,
except that you may not leave the grounds or put
yourself in danger of discovery,—a guest with all
the opportunities of meeting my niece that a recognized
suitor might have?”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a moment before Everell could speak.
“Sir, what does all this mean?” he cried. “Is it
a jest? In God’s name, don’t hold out such a prospect
merely to play with me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis a prospect in your power of realizing, upon
my honour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then your generosity—but generosity is too
mean a word—I know not how to describe your
action, nor to express my gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pray wait till you have heard the condition: to
everything there is a price.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whatever it be, ’twere cheap payment for such
happiness. I won’t disguise my love for your niece,
sir: why should I, when I began by confessing it?
To be with her all the day, without anxiety or
risk—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“For a week, I said.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such a week will be worth a lifetime!” Everell
declared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis well you count it so, for that is the price
at which it is offered. At the end of the week, I
mean, you shall be given up to the authorities. If
you accept this proposal, you will engage upon your
honour to surrender yourself at the appointed hour,
and to forego all chance of escape—though at the
same time every precaution will be taken to make
sure of you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“At the end of the week—given up?” repeated
Everell, again startled and open-eyed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Given up to the officers of justice, with advice
to use special care against your escape—though,
indeed, your word of honour will be the better
security. As to what will follow—your conveyance
to York, your trial, and the rest—” Foxwell
gave a shrug in lieu of finishing the sentence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A week,” said Everell, rather to himself than
to the company, “a week with <i>her</i>—to be absolutely
<i>sure</i> of that!—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A week with her,” said Foxwell, “and then to
face the judges. A few tedious days of imprisonment
and trial—hardly to be reckoned as days of
life—and ‘the rest is silence,’ as the play says.
How many possible years of life is it you would
forfeit to pay for this week? Two score, perhaps,—and
some of them years of fine young manhood,
too. Well, the choice is yours. You may give life
for love, if you wish. Or love for life, if you will:—my
first offer still holds—’tis still in your power
to go from this neighbourhood at once, perfectly
free, and to find your way abroad. Egad, when I
think how many joyous days and merry nights lie
between your age and mine!—Life is pleasant in
France.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I well know that,” said Everell, whose thoughts
had responded to the other’s words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are friends, I dare say, who would not
be sorry to see you again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Friends, yes,—dear friends!” mused Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis not fair, Foxwell,” Lady Strange put in;
“you are influencing him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say no more. Those are the alternatives, sir.
Once your choice is made, there shall be no going
back upon it: Love, or life:—if you decline to
choose, you are pretty certain to lose both.—Well,
sir, take a few minutes to think upon it. I see these
ladies are eager to hear your decision, but for once
you may leave them to their impatience.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell was not heedful of the ladies. Certain
words were echoing in his mind, each accompanied
by a rush of the ideas attached to it: life—love—friends—joyous
days and merry nights—but
never to see her again!—to fly from this neighbourhood,
from the garden.—Ah, the dear garden!
To be with the adored one for seven days—blissful
days, with her by his side, her hand in his, her eyes
softening to his, her voice—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir, could you doubt a moment?” said the
young lover. “I choose her!—a week with her!
I hold you to your word—I’ll not shirk mine when
the time comes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bravo! I knew it!” cried Lady Strange, clapping
her hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lady Strange, I owe you five guineas,” said
Foxwell, gallantly. “Mr. Everell, at this hour a
week hence—ten o’clock, shall we call it?—you
are my prisoner.” He rang the bell, and Caleb entered.
“Cut this gentleman’s cords—there has
been a mistake. And nothing is to be said of his
presence here, or of what has occurred to-night—nay,
I’ll give orders separately to all the servants.”
He waited till Everell stood entirely freed; he then
sent a message to Miss Foxwell, asking her to
come to the drawing-room if she had not yet
retired.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I take it,” he explained to Everell, when Caleb
had left the room, “you would have her know
at once how matters have fallen out—as far
as you would have her know at all for the present—that
you are to be our guest for awhile, at
least.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly,—but”—and here Everell turned
pale—“she must not know the condition.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I agree with you there,” said Foxwell, smiling.
“For the comfort of both of us, she had best not
know—till afterward, at least.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Afterward!” echoed Everell; “and what will
be her feelings then? I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have all overlooked that, I own. We have
thought only of you and your feelings. But you
need not be dismayed—the most devoted of women
are not inconsolable.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis not that I think she loves me much; but
she is of so tender a nature, when she learns the
price I shall have paid—yet how could I have
chosen otherwise, even considering her feelings?—what
would she have thought, had I preferred to
renounce her? Or suppose I had declined to
choose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, then, her feelings would be the same, on
your being handed over to justice at once, as they
will be a week hence. Nay, indeed, in a week’s
time she may not be as sorry to be rid of you. We
shall see when the time comes: if need be, we can
hide the truth from her then as now—when the
week is over, you can take your leave upon some
pretext, and trust time to efface your image from
her heart. Take my advice, trouble yourself not
about her feelings: be happy for a week, and don’t
think of ‘afterward.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell sighed, but in truth he could not at that
time see how her feelings could have been spared
in any measure by either of the other courses open
to him. Indeed, it seemed to him that fidelity to
her required him to elect as he had done; that any
other choice would have been a renunciation of her,
a treason to love. So let him be happy for a week:
at the end, it would be time to think how to save
her feelings.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well, sir,” he said to Foxwell; “let her
know nothing but that I am to be your guest for the
present.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So be it; and you will help us all to keep your
presence here a secret from the outside world. Best
never appear on the side of the house toward the
road.—But we can talk of that to-morrow, at
breakfast. I will lay the servants under the heaviest
charges, that they will hardly dare mention you to
one another. If you are discovered by Jeremiah
Filson or any such, not only may I fall under suspicion,
but your week may be cut short.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will be cautious, sir, if I have never been so
in my life before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you had best go by some other name in the
household. Shall we call you—ah—Mr. Charlson?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell signified his willingness, and the next
moment Georgiana entered, still dressed as she had
been in the garden. Her face was pale and anxious,
but her eyes brightened as they fell upon Everell
released from his bonds. She was close followed
by Prudence, whose nose shone red with the weeping
in which she had copiously indulged to the delight
and self-approval of her romantic soul.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Georgiana,” said Foxwell, before his niece
could speak, “this gentleman, Mr. Charlson, will
be our guest for a time. His visit must, for certain
reasons, be kept secret; and you, I am sure, will
not fail in the duties of a hostess. I am going now
to give orders for his accommodation.—Await me
here, if you please, Mr. Charlson. Ladies, I will
join you presently—in the library—and you,
Rashleigh.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The three London visitors took the hint and
sauntered into the adjoining room as Foxwell
passed out to the hall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What does it mean, Everell?” asked Georgiana,
in astonishment. “He has become your friend?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am to be your guest, as he has said,” replied
Everell, smiling as he took her hand. “I shall be
near you all the long day—as many hours as you
find it in your heart to give me. Sweet, ’tis too
great happiness!” He put his arm gently around
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Happiness!” said she, looking up into his eyes.
“’Tis more than I dare believe. My uncle shelters
you and befriends you!—Then there is nothing to
separate us—we may be happy together, day after
day—for ever!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He smiled, and summoned his wonted gaiety.
“Well, not—quite—for ever, my darling!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The smile and the gaiety had so nearly died out
ere he finished those few words, that he was fain
to draw her closer to him, that she might not see
his face.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c007'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>PROPOSALS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Let</span> us do Mr. Foxwell justice. He had honestly
believed that Everell would choose to renounce love
and be set free. This indeed would have been the
most humane event that any reasonable person
could have expected Foxwell to bring about. He
might, of course, have played the part of a beneficent
deity, and at once aided the Jacobite’s escape,
approved of his love, and sanctioned the future
union of the lovers. But he was no Mr. Allworthy.
Indeed it is more than doubtful whether Mr. Allworthy
himself would have carried benevolence to
that length. A flying rebel, with a price on his
head, whose possessions in the kingdom, if he had
any, were liable to confiscation, was not the suitor
a young lady’s relation could be supposed to favour
offhand. One even fears that the virtuous Allworthy
would rather have interpreted the duties of
loyalty in all strictness, and placed the captive in
the hands of justice immediately. But Foxwell,
with all his selfishness and callousness, was not the
man to make patriotism a vice to that extent, unless
there was something to gain or save by it. He
might be a heartless rake, but he was too much a
gentleman to practise that degree of Roman virtue
without any personal motive of profit or fear.</p>

<p class='c012'>So the best course had seemed to be to send the
fugitive packing, and nip this love-affair in the bud.
And that was what Foxwell had supposed would
result from the alternative offers. In any reasonable
issue of the matter, there must have been separation
for the lovers and sorrow for Georgiana.
Would that sorrow be ultimately greater for the
postponement, and for the probable deepening of the
attachment between the lovers? Perhaps; but Foxwell
had not looked for this outcome. The cruelty
of his little experiment upon the human passions,
then, consisted in his exposing the young lover’s
heart, and playing upon it, for the amusement of
onlookers. The cruelty of the intention was not
lessened by the fact that Everell himself, wholly
concerned as to his fate and his love, did not at
the time see himself as a man exhibited and played
upon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps Foxwell and his friends underwent some
self-reproach. However that be, it is certain they
had the delicacy to refrain from spying or intruding
upon the lovers during the week for which
Everell had so devotedly bargained. The party of
four went their way, and the party of two, attended
by the faithful Prudence, went theirs, both parties
meeting twice or thrice each day at meals. On these
occasions, a pleasant courtesy prevailed, and there
was no rallying of the lovers, no inquisitive observation
of them. Indeed it is doubtful if the feelings
of young lovers were ever more nicely considered.
The two found themselves always favoured by that
conspiracy which good-natured people customarily
form for the benefit of a young lady and her favoured
suitor. Everell found that he was not even
expected to remain at the table with the other gentlemen
after the ladies had gone, nor was it required
that he and Georgiana should join the latter
at the tea-table or at cards. The lovers’ chief place
of resort within the house was the library, a room
quite neglected by the others, who preferred only
the newest plays, poems, and magazines for their
reading. In good weather the lovers sat in the
old garden, or strolled in the park, Foxwell and
his visitors going farther afield for their outdoor
amusements, and receiving no company from the
neighbourhood. Thus the young couple, from their
meeting at breakfast to their parting at night, passed
all the hours together, in a singular freedom from
observant eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>We shall imitate Foxwell and his friends in this
abstention from prying; not because the love-making
of the two young people is sacred from us, but
because such love-making, interesting as it is to
the participants, is sadly tedious to the spectator.
The love-stories of actual people are interesting for
the events that give rise to their love, and to which
their love gives rise; not (excepting the critical
moments of the awakening, the unintentional disclosure,
the first confession, and such) for the regular
course of its own manifestation. The reader
who has dreaded the slow account of a week’s love-making—the
sighs, the gazes, the silences, the
hand-holdings, the poutings, the forgivings, and
all the rest—may breathe freely. The peculiar
pathos of the situation of these young lovers—a
pathos as yet perceptible only to Everell—did
not much alter their conduct from that of other
young lovers. For Everell made fair shift to put
the future out of sight, to regard only the day:
he was resolved not to look forward till the last
hour of his term should arrive. As long as he was
with Georgiana, he could keep to this: ’twas only
when he had retired to his own chamber that visions
of the approaching end would harass him in
the darkness; only then would he count the hours
that yet remained.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the eventful night of his capture, and after
Georgiana had retired, Everell had obtained Foxwell’s
permission to communicate with John Tarby
by means of the keeper, who, as he had learned
from Tarby himself, was privately on excellent
terms with the poacher. By this medium, then,
Everell had taken leave of his former host with
due expressions of thanks, both in words and in
gold, and had obtained the cloak-bag containing
his travelling equipment. Tarby had been left
under the impression that the young gentleman,
after being sheltered secretly for a time at Foxwell
Court, was to proceed upon his journey.</p>

<p class='c012'>That indeed was the impression of the servants
at Foxwell Court, and of Georgiana herself. Everell
did not tell her how long or short was to be his
visit, and she, glad enough to postpone all thought
of his departure, never broached the subject. Only
once did he hint at the probability of his leaving
her before many days. It was when, on Saturday
evening, she spoke of going to church next day.
“Nay,” he pleaded, with a sudden alarm in his
eyes, “you will have Sundays enough for church-going,
when I am not here.” It was not necessary
to say more; but he had to feign excessive lightness
of heart to quiet the vague apprehension his
own earnestness had raised in her mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell and his friends appeared at church that
Sunday without Georgiana. Her absence was noted
by one important person, at least, for, after the
service, Squire Thornby accosted Foxwell outside
the church porch, with a lack of preliminary salutation,
blurting out:</p>

<p class='c012'>“How now, neighbour Foxwell, ’tis no illness,
I hope, keeps Miss Foxwell home such a fine day?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No illness, thank you,” replied Foxwell, mildly;
“nothing of consequence, that is: my niece slept
rather badly last night, because of the wind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad ’tis nothing serious. Tell her I said
so, with my best compliments. Tell her she was
missed. We could better ’a’ spared you, Foxwell,—and
that’s a true word spoken in jest, if ever
there was one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This pleasantry was accompanied by a smile of
such confident insolence that the onlookers set their
ears for the piercing retort they thought sure to
come. It was on the tip of Foxwell’s tongue; but
he checked it, dropped his eyes, and sought refuge
in a feebly counterfeited laugh. His enemy looked
around triumphantly, and walked off. Foxwell,
who saw nothing in the Squire’s concern for Georgiana
but a pretext for rudeness to himself, digested
his chagrin in silence, though aware of the surprised
glances of Rashleigh and the ladies, to whom
he had mentioned his former method of dealing
with this booby.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next morning, as Foxwell was about to set
forth on horseback with his friends, the gamekeeper
sought an interview. Being ordered to
speak out, the man said that Squire Thornby’s people
had again broken down the fence on t’other side
of the four beeches, and were busy putting it up
again on the hither side. “Us were going to drive
them back, and were a’most come to blows, when
the Squire’s agent told us we’d best come first to
your Honour, and see as if you hadn’t changed your
mind about the rights o’ that bound’ry. He said it
in such a manner, sir, as how I thought maybe there
was some new agreement, or the courts had decided,
or something—begging pardon if I’m
wrong, sir. So, after a few words, I thought I’d
better see your Honour afore us starts a-breaking
heads.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell had been able to keep a clear brow, and
to stifle a bitter sigh, but he could not prevent his
face from turning a shade darker. His visitors,
who had heard the keeper’s tale, looked with curiosity
for the answer. After a moment’s silence,
Foxwell said: “Oh, damn the fence!—’tis no
matter:—yes, we’ve made a new agreement; let
Thornby’s men alone,” and turned his horse to ride
off with his guests.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was by turns morose and excessively mirthful
on that day’s excursion. In the afternoon, as
the four were riding up the slope toward the house,
they saw a mounted gentleman emerge through the
gateway. Nearing them, he proved to be Thornby.
Foxwell dissembled his inward rage, and had sufficient
self-command to greet his enemy with polite
carelessness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose you came to see me in regard to the
fence,” he added, reining in his horse. His companions
also stopped, on pretence of viewing the distant
sun-bathed hills to the west; but they listened
to what passed between their host and his foe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fence?” said Thornby. “Oh no, sir,—no
need to see you in regard to that. I don’t consult
anybody as to what I do on my own land—not
even such a wise fellow as you, Foxwell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I merely thought it required some particular
occasion to persuade you to visit us at Foxwell
Court. I heard you were—rebuilding the fence
by the four beeches.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So I am, that’s true enough. I intend to do a
considerable amount of rebuilding of that sort;
but I sha’n’t need to come to Foxwell Court on that
account. No; ’twas just the whim brought me
to Foxwell Court to-day—just a neighbourly visit,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then pray turn back with us,” said Foxwell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, thankye, sir. I’ve got business awaiting
me at home. Glad to find Miss Foxwell is quite
herself again.—No, I won’t trouble you in respect
of my fences, Foxwell,—not me. Good evening
to you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Squire’s assured, derisive manner made his
speeches doubly exasperating. As Foxwell rode on
with his guests, he could only suppose that his
enemy had come to Foxwell Court for the purpose
of exulting over him upon this new settlement of
the old boundary dispute. As the reader knows,
however, Foxwell Court had another attraction for
Mr. Thornby. He had, in fact, rejoiced at Foxwell’s
absence, and, upon arrival, had asked to see
Miss Foxwell. The servant found her walking in
the garden with Everell; but she sent her excuses
to the visitor, whom she then casually described
to Everell as a neighbour having some business
with her uncle. But the servant presently returned,
saying that Mr. Thornby declared his business important,
and would come to her in the garden
if it was a trouble for her to go to him in the
house.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fearing a second refusal might make the Squire
too inquisitive, Georgiana obtained leave from
Everell to go and get rid of this gentleman. As
she entered the drawing-room, where Thornby
waited, she began abruptly by saying that she was
very much occupied, and that she hoped his business
would not take many minutes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, now, I’ll tell you truth, Miss Foxwell,”
was the reply, “’twas just for another glimpse of
yourself that I came.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you said important business,” answered
Miss Foxwell, looking her displeasure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, and it was important to me. When I
thought of you, I couldn’t let my horse pass the
gate without turning in. To tell the truth again,
’twas the thought of you that made me ride in this
here direction. You wasn’t at church yesterday—I’d
been looking forward to see you there. For my
life, I ha’n’t been able to get your face out of my
head this whole week past, odd rabbit me if I have!—not
that I ever wanted to, neither.” The rustic
gentleman had lapsed into a state of red-faced confusion
which at another time Georgiana would have
pitied; but just now she was merciless in showing
her annoyance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m vastly flattered, Mr. Thornby; but you
have come at a time when I’m very much taken up
with my own affairs—very much taken up. So
I beg you’ll excuse me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, now, wait a minute, Miss Foxwell, as
you’ve got a kind Christian heart. Why, rat me!
if you knew as how I’ve pined to see you again
since t’other day, I’ll warrant you’d never go to
treat me so unneighbourly.  If you knew as
how—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Really I must go, Mr. Thornby,—really.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why can’t we be neighbourly, Miss Foxwell,—us
two? Your uncle and me ha’n’t always been
sworn brothers, so to speak, but I think as how
we shall be mending that; and if you’d only just—er—ah—be
neighbourly like—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m perfectly willing we should be good neighbours,
Mr. Thornby,—perfectly. But just now
if you’ll do me the favour to excuse—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, that’s what I hoped for from such a sweet,
gentle face, Miss Foxwell. Perfectly willing to be
good neighbours. You make me a happy man, by
the lord Harry, you do that! Ecod, if you knew
as how I’ve laid awake nights this week past—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana, convinced that fair means would not
serve, feigned a sudden dizziness, which threw the
Squire into such embarrassment, as he knew nothing
of what to do for a lady in a faint, that he was
very glad to leave the field, though he manfully
remained until she declared she was better and
would entirely recover if left alone. As soon as
she saw him ride out of the courtyard, she went
back to Everell in the garden.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How long you stayed!” said he.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, if you knew this gentleman!—so stupid,
and repeating himself a hundred times:—and after
all, ’twas nothing I could be of use in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alluded to in this careless manner, the personality
of Thornby awakened no curiosity in Everell’s
mind. He vaguely remembered the name as that
of a landowner in the neighbourhood, whom the
innkeeper and John Tarby had mentioned. How
glad Mr. Foxwell would have been could he have
felt a like indifference with regard to the Squire!
The reader is aware of their encounter as Thornby
was riding down the slope that afternoon. As soon
after that as Foxwell found himself alone with
Rashleigh, his vexation broke out in words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Damn that Thornby! Damn, damn, damn
him!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The gentleman you were accustomed to take
down in company, didn’t you tell us?” said Rashleigh
with marked innocence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, George, laugh at me: I deserve it, I own.
But something has happened since I told you that.
No doubt you remember, the fellow came to see
me the other day. Do you know what he showed
me then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not I—unless it was a list of men he had
killed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alas, nothing of that sort. To make a long
story short, years ago in London, when I was in
bad straits, I wrote a foolish letter—imbecile that
I was!—wrote it in the madness of anger, poverty,
imprisonment,—in the recklessness of drink.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We make such blunders now and then, certainly,”
was Rashleigh’s sage comment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I soon enough realized my blunder. The recipient
of the letter—he is dead now—told me he
had burnt it. It contained things I should be sorry
to have everybody see.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if it was burnt?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It wasn’t: there was trickery somewhere. And
the letter is now in the possession of this Thornby.
’Tis the real letter—I recognized it. He will show
it to the world if I provoke him. Till I can get
it from him—and heaven knows how that is to
be done: he is a cunning fellow, and on the <i>qui
vive</i>—well, now you understand my meekness.
He really has me at his mercy—hardly less than
I have the Jacobite yonder at mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From the window the gentlemen could see Everell
and Georgiana strolling within the verge of the
park. As Foxwell evinced no mind to say more
about Thornby or the letter, but rather seemed to
dismiss them with a sigh of disgust, Rashleigh took
the cue for a change of subject.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you really hand over the Jacobite, after all,
Bob?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I haven’t thought much of that matter,” replied
Foxwell. “I frankly didn’t expect him to
choose as he did.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“His time is coming to an end,” said Rashleigh.
“You will soon have to decide.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, deuce take it, has he not decided for himself?
What can I do but hand him over? Were
I to let him go free, he would probably be caught,
nevertheless: in the end I should be in trouble for
having harboured him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll pardon me, of course, for introducing
the subject. We’ve all avoided it, as you set the
example of doing. But to-day Lady Strange was
hoping that you could find it in your heart to let
the young fellow go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I could find it in my heart; but should
I find it to my interest? Several possibilities have
occurred to me, but they all seem attended by risk
or inconvenience. The safest and easiest course is
clearly to observe both the law and our agreement.
The man Filson is still in the village. He seems
to have an instinct that his prey is in the neighbourhood—nay,
as he looked at me yesterday at church,
I could almost imagine he suspected something.
He has a clue, perhaps. He told Caleb he might
be hereabouts for another fortnight. So you see—well,
I can make up my mind at the last moment
if need be—one can always toss a coin. ’Tis time
we were changing our clothes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>On the afternoon of the last day of Everell’s
week, something occurred to bring Foxwell to a
decision without recourse to the toss of a coin.
Georgiana having mentioned to Everell a miniature
portrait of herself, he had eagerly expressed
a desire to see it. He had thought she would send
Prudence for it, but Georgiana, saying that she
alone could find it, and that she would return in
a minute, left Everell in the garden. As she entered
the hall, on the way to her apartments, she
saw her uncle there in the act of greeting Squire
Thornby, who had evidently just dismounted from
his horse. She curtsied, and essayed to pass swiftly
to the stairs, but Thornby intervened.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, one moment, Miss Foxwell,” said he,
with precipitation, and looking very red in the face.
“I’m going to say something to your uncle that
concerns you.” As he stood directly in her way,
she had no choice but to stop. She did not conceal
her impatience. “It needn’t keep you long,”
Thornby went on, “for I won’t beat about the
bush. Mr. Foxwell, I may say without vanity I’m
a man of some substance as fortunes go in this here
part of the world. And, in course, you know I’m
a bachelor. Not because I’m a woman-hater, but
because, to be all open and aboveboard, I never
yet saw the woman in these parts that I thought fit
to be mistress of Thornby Hall—damn me if I
ever did!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can understand your feeling, Mr. Thornby,”
said Foxwell, while the Squire paused and glared
at both uncle and niece.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is to say,” resumed Thornby, “never till
a few days ago. Ecod, it seems more than a few
days, one way I look at it! I mean, I saw your
niece—yes, you, Miss Foxwell, I say it to your
face. Now the secret’s out. I hadn’t thought to
come to the point so soon—I thought to go softly,
and court the young lady awhile, and so forth—but
hang me if I desire to wait and give somebody
else a chance to carry off such a prize.—Well,
what d’ye say, Miss Foxwell?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana was quite too confounded to say anything.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She says you do us a great honour, Mr.
Thornby,” put in Foxwell, discreetly; “a very
great honour. My niece, I am sure, is fully sensible
of the honour. But are you aware how small
her fortune is?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hang fortunes! I’ve enough for two!” cried
Thornby.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then, sir,” went on Foxwell, with quiet
frankness, “upon her marriage, you must know,
the division of our estate will leave me rather ill
provided for. That would not influence me, were
she not so young; but, as it is, she can very well
afford to wait two or three years, during which
I may improve my affairs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You sha’n’t suffer, Foxwell,” said the Squire,
bluntly: “you shall come out of the affair as well
provided for as both of you now are together. But
what does the lady say?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The lady says, no!” And emphatically she said
it, too, now that she had found her voice. “I
thank you very much, Mr. Thornby; but ’tis not
to be heard of!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, come now, Miss Foxwell! Don’t be so
determined all in a moment. Consider it—be kind—be—be
neighbourly!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis not to be heard of, I assure you, Mr.
Thornby. No, no, no, I say! I will never consider
it—I will never—” As Thornby still barred her
path to the stairs, she turned suddenly and hastened
from the hall by the way she had entered. After
making sure she was not followed, she rejoined
Everell, with an excuse for postponing her quest of
the miniature. She trusted to her uncle to soften the
refusal of Thornby’s offer; for she could not but
think, although she had nobody’s word for it, that
Foxwell had decided to favour Everell as her suitor—a
turn she attributed to some assurance of Everell’s
prospects in France, which, she supposed, the
fugitive had given Foxwell on the night of the capture.
Indeed in no other way could she account
for the strange situation that existed; she was
glad enough to accept without question a state of
affairs in which she found joy for the present and
hope for the future.</p>

<p class='c012'>But her exit from the hall did not finish the scene
there. Thornby, after staring open-mouthed a moment,
addressed himself to Foxwell:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ecod, why should she fly out like that—well,
well, I haven’t the gift of fine speech. You have
that, Foxwell, and I look to you to persuade her,
d’ye hear? I’ll make it worth your while. The
day I marry her, you shall have back that there
letter we both know of; but if she won’t have me,
damme if I know what use I sha’n’t make of
it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hold you to that promise,” said Foxwell,
quickly, “and to what you mentioned in regard
to terms of settlement.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As to providing for you, and so forth? You’ll
find me as good as my word: I’ll have my lawyer
ready for yours the minute she gives her consent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis but a girl’s coyness that stands in the way:
we shall break that in a little time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, no force, neither!” said Thornby. “It
must be of her own free will—she must tell me
herself she takes me willingly—you’re to persuade,
not compel.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I dare say I’d best not see her again to-day,”
the Squire faltered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not for a few days, at the least, I should advise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I suppose you know. I’ll do my best to
bide patient for two days.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I scarcely hope to change her mind within
a week,” said Foxwell, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll come to see how you fare, nevertheless.—If
you <i>do</i> succeed sooner than you hope, send me
word immediately.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Left alone, Foxwell paced the hall, in cogitation.
He was joined presently by Rashleigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Egad, Bob, your meditations must have grown
pleasanter, to make you smile to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Was I smiling? Well, you must know my
excellent niece has received an offer of marriage—a
mighty advantageous one. The little fool
spurns it: the Jacobite stands in the way, of course,
and will as long as he is alive to communicate with
her. I shall have to do my duty as a loyal subject
of King George, I see.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But will she be the more favourable to another
suitor, while the one she loves is about being
hanged?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps I can keep the Jacobite’s fate from
her knowledge. ’Tis plain he hasn’t told her of
our bargain: he probably will not tell her—probably
will but announce his departure on some pretext—may
indeed say nothing of it, leaving us to
break it. I will deliver him up to-night, but not
in her presence. At ten o’clock his claims cease.
If he has meanwhile prepared her for his going,
well and good: if not, she shall think he has taken
sudden leave for his own reasons. Hearing no
more of him, she will put his silence down to inconstancy;
in that case, pride may incline her to
the other man. If she learns the truth, she will
be too broken to resist my persuasions long.—I’m
sorry for the rebel: but there’s much at stake for
me in the affair—and ’tis only what he agreed
to and expects—what he risked before ever I saw
him—his just deserts under the law. The girl
will suffer, too,—but not for many days. I hope
he will not tell her the full truth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell himself was in doubt as to what he should
tell her. He was trying still to postpone consideration
of the end so close at hand. He was sorely
perplexed for her sake, for he knew now how far
beyond mere compassion her love was.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c007'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>TEARS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Everell’s</span> last meal at Foxwell Court was not
marked by lively conversation. He had his own
thoughts, or, rather, his own confused and whirling
state of mind, so that he scarce knew whether the
others spoke or were silent. Outwardly he still
maintained a brave face, so that Georgiana might
not yet be alarmed. The young lady herself had
never taken much part in the table talk. Lady
Strange and Rashleigh felt the occasion too sensibly
to be capable of easy discourse, and Foxwell
knew a gentleman’s part too well to intrude a gaiety
either real or feigned. He quietly kept the ball
rolling, however, with Mrs. Winter, who alone—save
Georgiana—seemed untouched by the shadow
of coming events.</p>

<p class='c012'>As soon as the ladies had finished, Georgiana
left the room for the library. Everell, with a bow
to the company, turned to follow her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lady Strange, already risen, laid a gentle hand
upon his sleeve and said, softly: “Upon my soul,
sir, I pity you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked at her a moment; then, summoning a
smile, answered: “I thank you from my heart;
but ’tis not near ten o’clock. I have some hours
yet remaining. Ladies, your servant.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When he had gone out, Mrs. Winter said: “So
you may keep your pity till ten o’clock, Diana. Sure
the young fellow carries it off well. ’Twill be
worth seeing if he does so to the end. Ten o’clock—’tis
several hours off, and card-playing begins
to be tedious. What a long evening ’twill be!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Short enough for those two young lovers,”
said Lady Strange, with a sigh, as she passed to
the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose you have made your arrangements,
Bob,” said Rashleigh, when the two gentlemen were
alone; “for delivering him up, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are very simple. I will send Joseph with
a message to Jeremiah Filson an hour or so before
ten o’clock. Filson will require a little time to
muster the justice’s men; he may have to go to
Thornby Hall—no doubt Thornby’s clerk will
command the party, to make sure that all is regular.
So ’twill scarce be possible for them to arrive
before ten: in any case, I’ll warn Filson they
mustn’t do so. Till ten I may not call the rebel
from Georgiana’s presence. I hope he will leave
her in ignorance. Well, we shall see.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In the library Georgiana sat reading to her lover.
What the words meant, what the book was, he
hardly knew; she would have preferred to be the
listener, but in that case he would have had to keep
his eyes upon the page, and he would rather keep
them upon her face. He could interrupt when he
chose, and then her eyes rose to meet his; so that
he often interrupted. Suddenly he remembered the
miniature she had started to get for him in the
afternoon; and now the desire to possess it—to
have that image of her beauty to carry with him
to the end—grew strong in a moment. He reminded
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>She rose at once to go to her room for it, saying,
as before, that only she could find it. He followed
her through the dining-room; which was now deserted,
as Foxwell and Rashleigh had soon joined
the ladies in the drawing-room. In the wide entrance-hall,
as Everell could accompany her no farther,
he caught her hand lightly, and said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be long in finding it, I pray. Remember,
every moment—” He checked himself, and
turned the supplication to gaiety by a smile. “Be
considerate of my impatience, dear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Struck by his manner, she looked searchingly at
his face. But he kissed her hand in a playful way,
and gave it a little toss toward the stairway; up
which she hastened a moment later, reassured.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a footman stationed in the entrance-hall,
and Everell, not wishing his mood to be observed,
went back into the dining-room to await
Georgiana’s return. He still held in one hand the
book from which she had been reading. He turned
the pages, gazing at the words, but receiving no
impression from them. The table remained as the
gentlemen had left it, except that the candelabrum
had been removed, only two candles in wall-sconces
remaining to light the room. The fire in the chimney-place
was low, and the air rather chill, for
the evening had set in with a cold wind. “Little
do I care, though it freeze and blow,” thought
Everell, standing by the fireplace. “Why does she
delay? Cruel!—but she knows not. The minutes!—the
minutes I am losing!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But in truth she was expeditious, and so quiet in
her return that she entered the room before he had
heard her step. He went to her with a subdued cry,
seized the miniature from her hand, and pressed it—and
then the hand itself—with passionate tenderness
to his lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It shall never leave me,” he said. “It shall
be the last thing I look upon—it shall feel the last
beat of my heart.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But that will be many, many years in the future,”
said Georgiana, with a half-comic air of complaint,
“and meanwhile you don’t even look at the
picture now!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Time enough for that!—Let me look only at
you now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean? There is time enough for
looking at me, too. Tell me if the likeness flatters
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing could do that. ’Tis a lovely portrait—never
was a lovelier; but the eyes are not as
sweet as the original’s—nor the face as angelic—nor
the hair as soft—nor the colour as fair—nor
the look as tender. ’Tis nothing to the life—and
yet ’tis adorable. ’Twas kindly thought, to
give it me,—more kindly than you know, dear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He kissed it once more; then, having placed it
carefully in the breast pocket of his waistcoat, took
both her hands, and regarded her with an intentness
that reawoke the vague alarm she had felt in the
hall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why do you look in that manner, Everell?
Why do you speak so strangely this evening? You
make me almost afraid—for you, that is—nay,
for both of us. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing—nothing, sweet!” But whatever he
might say, it was no longer possible for him to
counterfeit either gaiety or unconcern with any success.
“God knows, I would be the same now—I
would have us both be the same now—as we
have been all this week. I grudge every thought
that we give to anything but our love. Let us have
the full worth of each moment, to the very end.—Nay,
what am I saying? I rave, I think. Yes,
yes, dear, I speak strangely—strangely was well
said.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everell, you frighten me! What is behind all
this?—what is it you have in mind?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only you, dear: you, as you are at this instant.
There is nothing but this instant—no past, no
future!—there is only <i>now</i>, with you in my arms,
and your eyes looking into mine. Oh, if the course
of time could be stopped, and this moment last for
ever!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should be content,” said Georgiana, taking
refuge in the possibility that his manner might be
the effect of a transient excess of emotion, such
as ardent lovers sometimes experience. “But
haven’t we all our lives in which to love each other?
We must only guard against your being taken. But
you’ll be safe once you are out of England—as
you will be by and by—not yet, of course. And
then after awhile we shall meet again in France.
My only dread is of the separation meanwhile—’tis
fearful to think of separation, even for a short
time, but doubtless it must be—” She broke off,
with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, must be!” Everell replied, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it must not be long. I believe my uncle
will be glad of an occasion to visit France. And
then, when danger and separation are past, what
happiness!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She had, it will be seen, formed her own plans
for the future; and had talked of them, too, more
than once in the last few days, taking her lover’s
acquiescence for granted, as indeed his manifestations
of love gave her full right to do. Such initiative
on the woman’s side is, by a convention
of romancers, assumed to be indelicate; if it be so,
then the world must grant that real women are
not the delicate creatures they have been taken for.
Be that as it may, Georgiana’s dreams of the future
had been bitter-sweet hearing to Everell, though
he saw nothing indelicate in her mentioning them.
Yet he could not bring himself to disillusion her.
But now at last, when the hour was drawing
near—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, talk not of the future, dear,” he said, holding
her close in his arms, and endeavouring to speak
without wildness. “There is only the present, I
say. Life is full of uncertainty. Who can tell?
This separation—it may be final—we may not
see each other again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now you start my fears again!” cried Georgiana.
“You puzzle me to-night, Everell. There’s
something in your thoughts—something in your
heart. Look at me: you are pale—one would
suppose a calamity was before us. What is it?
Oh, in the name of heaven, tell me!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, ’tis nothing, I protest.—And yet you
must know too soon. Why not from me? Who
has such love for you as I have? who can feel for
you as I can? who would try so fondly to console?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are right, Everell; let me hear it from
you! Oh, speak, dear!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis—only this, sweetheart,” he said, when he
could command his voice: “we are to part soon.
I am going away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Soon? How soon? Certainly, you must go
to France—but not yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, that is it, dear: I must go, I know not how
soon. Perhaps—this very night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This night? Impossible! You have said nothing
to me of going—’tis too unexpected!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forgive me, dear,” he pleaded, simply. “I
wished not to cloud our happiness with any thought
of separation; so I never spoke of—my day of
departure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, but I must have time—to strengthen my
heart! And we have arranged nothing yet—in
regard to meeting again—no particulars. There
is everything to be discussed before you go. This
separation—how long is it to last?” Her voice
and eyes were on the verge of tears.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Longer, dear, than I have the heart to tell!—Oh,
sweet, forgive, forgive me! When I bargained
for one blissful week, ’twas only of myself I
thought—I weighed my happiness against only
the price <i>I</i> was to pay. I considered not what you
might feel—that a week might turn your fancy
into love, and make our parting as cruel for you as
for me. Forgive me, dearest, and charge the sin
to my love of you—my unthinking, inconsiderate
love!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, dear, there is nothing to forgive,” she
said, with sorrowful compassion. “Parting will
be hard—heaven knows it will!—but I must set
my thoughts on our next meeting. The separation
will be—somewhat long, do you say?—ah, that’s
sad to hear. How long, Everell?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He turned his face from her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Speak, Everell,” she pleaded; “how long?—a
year?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Longer than that,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Longer!—oh, pity me, heaven!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Besides the doors at either end of this dining-parlour,
to the library and the hall, there was at
one side a third, which led to the drawing-room.
This door now opened, and Lady Strange appeared:
seeing the lovers, she closed it gently behind her.
They stood clinging to each other, with looks sorrowful
and distraught.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have told her, then?” she said, in a tone
softened by compassion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Almost,” replied Everell; and Georgiana began
to sob.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My poor child,” said Lady Strange, “from my
heart I grieve for you. Sir, we are all much to
blame. Had we foreseen this a week ago!—Would
that this week could be recalled, for the sake of
this child’s happiness! I have pleaded with Foxwell;
but he is determined to deliver you up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What!—deliver—” Georgiana became for
a moment speechless; then uttered a scream, and
was like to have fallen to the floor, had not Everell
grasped her more tightly in his arms.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Heaven pity her!—my dear love!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, then—did she not know?” cried Lady
Strange.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not the whole truth—only that I was going
away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was about to carry Georgiana to a chair, but
she suddenly regained her strength.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Deliver you up!” she said, excitedly. “My
uncle shall not! You shall put it out of his power!
Escape now, while you may! Go—we’ll meet
again.” She essayed to push him toward the hall,
keeping her glance the while on the drawing-room
door by which her uncle might enter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot,” said Everell. “I’ve given him my
word—’twas to purchase this week of love, sweet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your word! He shall not claim it of you!
Your word!—oh, heaven help me, you would keep
your word though it broke my heart!—honour,
you call it!—’tis men’s madness, women are no
such fools!—Nay, forgive me, I would not love
you else. But he shall not hold you to your word.
He shall not deliver you up. He shall release you.”
She broke from Everell’s clasp, and flung open the
drawing-room door, calling, “Uncle! Uncle!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell appeared, with some playing cards in
his hand. He was slightly pallid, and wore the
frown of one to whom has fallen a vexation he has
dreaded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Uncle, you will not deliver him up? You will
release him from his word? You will let him go
free, will you not? ’Tis no gain to you that he
should die. Speak!—uncle, tell me you’ll not deliver
him up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My child, you do not understand these matters,”
replied Foxwell, patiently resorting to a judicial
softness of speech. “Mr. Everell himself, as
a soldier, who assumed the chance of war and lost,
knows what my duty is—knows I once even offered
to forget that duty, had he but accepted the
condition.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly I have but myself to blame,” said
Everell. “For myself I make no complaint. For
her, alas! my heart bleeds. I can but pray she will
soon forget.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forget!” cried Georgiana. “Indeed, no! I
say you shall not die, Everell. Uncle, I beg you,
on my knees—his life! Sure you can’t be my
kinsman and refuse—you can’t be a sharer of the
same blood as flows in me, and be so cruel. Answer
me, uncle!—you will spare him, will not
you? You say you once offered to forget your
duty: if you could forget it once, you can again,
cannot you?”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“‘UNCLE, I BEG YOU, ON MY KNEES—HIS LIFE!’”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, ’tis not possible now, niece; circumstances
have altered. ’Twould be useless for me to explain.
I can only beg you to end this supplication, Georgiana,—it
will not serve you. I am not to be moved.
Mr. Everell will say whether I have dealt fairly
with him—would have dealt more than fairly, had
he but willed. ’Tis all vastly to be regretted. Had
he chosen so a week since, your sorrow had been
much less. Had you bestowed your confidence
upon me when he first came here, you might have
been spared all sorrow. As it is, events must take
their course.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, my God, can one’s own kin be so heartless?
To send him to death, who is more than life to me!
What has he done?—what injury to you? He
only fought for the prince in whose right he believed.
Had his side won, <i>he</i> would have been
merciful. What harm will it do you to let him go?—what
harm to the kingdom, now the rebellion
is put down? ’Tis profitless, ’tis needless, ’twill
serve nothing, that he should die.—Oh, heaven,
soften my uncle’s heart!—let him see as I see,
feel as I feel!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell, little relishing these vehement appeals,
or the sight of the kneeling girl with supplicating
hands, turned to Everell:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir, this can accomplish nothing. I will leave
you with her till the appointed time—though perhaps
it were more kind to—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no!” cried Georgiana, grasping her uncle’s
coat-skirt as he made to step back into the drawing-room.
“Do not go!—uncle, hear me! Anything
for his life!—only his life! I will do anything,
give anything—only that he may not die!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell looked down at her. The birth of a
thought showed on his face, clearing away his
frown of annoyance. Again he turned to Everell,
and said, quietly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir, will you grant me a few minutes alone with
my niece? The time shall be made up after, if you
choose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell stood hesitating.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go, Everell,” said Georgiana, eagerly; “’tis
for our advantage.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I pray it may be for yours, sweet,” replied
Everell, gently, and went into the library, closing
the door after him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lady Strange, conceiving herself not wanted,
would have passed Foxwell to retire to the drawing-room;
but he softly closed that door, and said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, Lady Strange, don’t go. I had as lief
you heard this. Georgiana, you ask for this gentleman’s
life: now if that were all—” He paused
for effect.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All!” echoed Georgiana, now risen to her feet;
“’tis everything! I ask no more. You will grant
it, then?—you will make me happy?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you would indeed be content with that—and
his freedom—” Foxwell still seemed to halt
in doubt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will be,” Georgiana declared, emphatically;
“only say he shall live.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you would abandon any dreams you may
have entertained of marriage—of future meetings
with him—of correspondence, in the event of my
saving him from the gallows—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will abandon whatever you require,—only
to know that he goes free, only to feel that somewhere
in the world he lives!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” said Foxwell, slowly, “I will let him
go free—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana uttered a cry of joy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“—if,” continued Foxwell, “you will accept the
proposal—the very advantageous proposal—which
Mr. Thornby has done you the honour of
making.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Accept the proposal—of Mr. Thornby?” repeated
Georgiana, in utter surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—give your consent to the marriage, of
your own free will, letting it be clear that there
has been no force or compulsion to influence you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” Georgiana faltered, looking distressedly
toward the door by which Everell had left the
room, “I cannot love Mr. Thornby.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis not absolutely necessary you should love
him,” replied Foxwell, dryly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no, no!” cried Georgiana, as her imagination
fully mastered the case. “I cannot! ’Twould
be like—’twould be horrible!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Twould be saving your Everell’s life,” said
Foxwell, dispassionately.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis an excellent match, dear,” put in Lady
Strange, softly, “if Mr. Thornby’s estate is what
I take it to be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but, Lady Strange,—you are a woman—<i>you</i>
should understand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do, child,” replied the elder lady, with an
inward sigh, “but—these matters reconcile themselves
in time. ’Twill not be so intolerable, believe
me. And who knows—” Whatever it was that
who knew, Lady Strange abruptly broke off to
another line of thought. “The point is, to save
your lover’s life, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay,” said Foxwell, beginning to show impatience,
“ere the opportunity is gone. Now lookye,
Georgiana, I must hear your answer without more
ado. I am going to have a horse saddled at once.
It shall carry either your acceptance to Mr.
Thornby, or word of this rebel to those who will
not be slow in securing him. ’Tis for you to say
which, and before many minutes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Instead of calling a servant, Foxwell went out to
the hall to give the order, consigning Georgiana
by a look to the persuasions of Lady Strange.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, my dear,” said that lady, bending kindly
over Georgiana, who had sunk weeping into a chair
by the table; “’tis but marrying him you love not,
for the sake of him you love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis being false to him I love,” sobbed the girl.</p>

<p class='c012'>“False to him, but to save his life—a loyal
kind of falseness, poor child!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She continued in this strain, though with no
apparent effect upon Georgiana, who presently flung
her arms upon the table and, bowing her head upon
them, shook with weeping. In this attitude her
uncle found her when he returned from ordering
the horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, persuade her no more, Lady Strange,”
said he, testily. “God’s name, miss!—be true to
your lover, if you think it so, and send him to die
for your truth. I am going now to write a line
for my messenger to carry. It might have been a
line to Thornby, accompanied by a few words of
your own inditing. But, as it cannot be so, it must
be to those who want news of the rebel.” With
that, Foxwell was about to go to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no!” exclaimed Georgiana, rising to stop
him. “I will consent—I will save the rebel.
False to him, for love of him!—he will understand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, but he is not to understand,” objected
Foxwell. “He is to know nothing of this. Do
you not see, he might rather give himself up than
have you marry another?—might refuse to be
saved by such means. For his own sake, he mustn’t
know the condition. You had best not see him
again: leave me to dismiss him. I make no doubt
he will accept his liberty now for your sake, and
agree to the voiding of our compact, whereof he
has had near the full benefit. Best not see him:
you might betray all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not see him!” wept Georgiana.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis best not. If he stand to our agreement
and demand to see you, why, then, so it must be,
and I know not what will ensue. Do not fear I
shall misrepresent you to him. He shall know
you have won his life by your pleading, upon condition
he goes away forthwith—that is all. ’Tis
agreed to, then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” said Georgiana, faintly; and added as
if speaking to herself, “I shall know that somewhere
he lives!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this instant the door from the library opened,
whereupon Foxwell looked around sharply, thinking
Everell had taken it upon himself to reappear
unbidden. But the intruder proved to be the waiting-woman
Prudence, who had fallen asleep over
her sewing while Georgiana was reading to Everell,
and whom the lovers had left unnoticed in her
corner. Having just now wakened, and seen Everell
alone before the fireplace, looking strangely pale
and excited, she had come forth in quest of her
mistress. In obedience to Foxwell’s imperious motion,
she shut the door, and hastened to the half-swooning
niece.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then,” said Foxwell to Georgiana, “I beg you
will go to your room and write a brief letter to
Mr. Thornby, informing him you accept his proposal
of marriage, conditionally upon such terms
as your representative—and so forth. Lady
Strange will perhaps be so kind as to advise you
in the wording—the form matters little, only let
it be plain you act of your free will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of my free will—yes,” murmured Georgiana,
wearily, accepting the guidance of Lady Strange’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When the letter is finished, send it down to
me straightway; and best keep to your room for
the rest of the evening,” added Foxwell, as Lady
Strange and the girl passed out to the hall.</p>

<p class='c012'>Prudence followed them up the stairs, but stopped
for a moment outside Georgiana’s anteroom, to
give oral expression to her feelings: “Marry Mr.
Thornby! Oh, lor! What will the Jacumbite say
to this, I wonder?”</p>

  <h2 id='ch13' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>SURPRISES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Left</span> alone in the dining-room, Foxwell first
indulged in a momentary smile of satisfaction, as
who should say, “For once has circumstance been
kind to me;” and then, setting himself to the task
yet remaining, he opened the library door, and
called Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>The young man came without delay; looked
swiftly around the room, and then at Foxwell with
eyes that said, “She is not here!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She has gone to her room,” said Foxwell, very
quietly. “I have granted her request: you are
to go free.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go free!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“At her solicitation, and solely for her sake.
For her sake, then, and for mine, too, if you consider
not your own, I beg you will be secret in
your departure—and above all, speedy. You must
be especially on your guard against Jeremiah Filson,
who still lodges at the public-house in the village
yonder. Were I in your place, I wouldn’t pass
through the village, I would go to Burndale and
take conveyance there. But however you proceed,
though I may seem inhospitable to urge it, you
should set out immediately. You have money, I
believe: if not, my purse—though I could wish
it better lined—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, a thousand thanks, but I have enough.
As to this release, I know not what to say: I never
would have asked it—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you must accept it, for the sake of her who
did ask it. I well know you would have stood to
our compact. Stay not for protestations or thanks:
the sooner you are gone, the better for us all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But ’tis not yet ten o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good heaven, sir, does it not follow that our
agreement is annulled by your release if you accept
it?—and your duty to her leaves you no choice
but to accept. Will you stand upon an hour or two,
when you’ve had near full benefit of the bargain
for nothing, as it turns out?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are right,” said Everell, with humility.
“I will go as soon as I have said farewell to
her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, my dear sir, that very ordeal is one you
must spare her. Do you not see how the case
stands? She was in great terror lest you should
be given up: relieved upon that point, she asks
no more. She is content with having gained your
life: in that mood, she is willing to forego another
meeting. It would only start her grief afresh: for
that reason, I advised her to go to her room. As
you value her peace, you must depart without seeing
her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Depart without seeing her!” Everell looked
wistfully toward the hall, through which she must
have passed to reach her apartments. He fetched
a long and tremulous sigh; then bethought him
of the miniature, and, taking it out, stood gazing
on it with moist eyes. He gently kissed it, and
replaced it in his pocket. “Well, sir, heaven knows
I wouldn’t cause her fresh grief. But this I may
ask—nay, must know:—when shall I be permitted
to see her again?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis not in my power to answer, your own
future being unknown to me. Certainly you mustn’t
see her during your present stay in England—which,
if you are wise, you will devote entirely to
getting out of England. As to the future more
distant, all depends upon how matters shape themselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“At least, then, I may hope! She will be true,
I know. There will be an amnesty some day, and
I may return to England without danger. In the
meantime, you—and she—may be coming to
France. I will write to her from there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And not till you have arrived there, I trust.
Until your safety is assured, any communication
from you must give a new edge to her anxiety.
But I demand no promises.” Foxwell intended to
expedite the marriage: once his purposes were
secured, Georgiana’s conduct would be Thornby’s
affair. Now that her consent had been obtained,
haste was possible. Meanwhile, he could intercept
any letter that came by regular post. Therefore,
’twas better not to force Everell to secret means
of correspondence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, sir,” said Everell, with a wan attempt at
a smile, “as you demand no promises, I will make
none. On the hope of meeting her again, in safer
times, I shall live. In that hope, I must go. Tell
her—” he paused a moment, but his thoughts
were in a tumult—“Nay, words are too feeble!
I thank her, not for my life, which is hers to use
as she will; but for her love, which gives my life all
its value. Adieu, sir!—no more!”</p>

<p class='c012'>With that, he hastened abruptly, half-blindly, to
the hall; and thence to his chamber, where he
donned his sword, hat, cloak, and riding-boots. He
threw his few other belongings into the bag, made
sure his money was safe in pocket, and returned to
the hall, thinking to leave by way of the courtyard
and thus soonest gain the road. There was the
darkness for his safety, and the whirl of his
thoughts to speed him on to Burndale, where he
could knock up some innkeeper, and take horse for
the South at dawn.</p>

<p class='c012'>Caleb and another servant, charged by Foxwell
to attend the departing guest to the gate, were at
the door. Everell handed each a coin, and the
second man ran ahead to open the gate. Everell
was following across the dark courtyard, when he
bethought him of the services of Prudence. He
turned back to the light of the open doorway, selected
a gold piece, and asked Caleb to convey it
to the maid.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If it please your Honour, sir, asking your pardon,
may I call Miss Prudence to receive it herself?”
said Caleb; “’twill take but a minute.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Perceiving that the valet was averse to the trust,
Everell acquiesced. The idea then came to him
that he might utilize the brief delay by writing a
message of farewell to Georgiana: there could be
no objection to a few written words of love and
faith, which Prudence might deliver at a suitable
time. Everell strode into the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nobody else was there, for Foxwell had returned
to the drawing-room to pen a letter which should
accompany Georgiana’s to Thornby. He had begun
to apologize to Rashleigh and Mrs. Winter for the
long trial he had put upon their patience.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You might at least have left the door ajar,
that we could have heard your fine scenes yonder,”
said Mrs. Winter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So I might have done, I own,” replied Foxwell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes; as you didn’t, we thought ourselves
justified in listening at the keyhole.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We?” exclaimed Rashleigh, in protest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, if you didn’t listen, Rashleigh, you certainly
didn’t stop my telling you what I heard.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you know what has happened?” queried
Foxwell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I could make a good guess at the general
event,” answered the lady. “The rebel goes free,
and pretty Georgiana marries for love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“For love!” said Foxwell. “Hardly so, I fear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly. For love of one man, she marries
another. ’Tis often done—especially in France.
’Tis a plan that has its beauties.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m afraid Georgiana is too English to see its
beauties,” said Rashleigh, as Foxwell sat down to
write his letter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Return we to another writer, in the adjoining
room. Everell had found the book from which
Georgiana had been reading to him, which he had
dropped in going to support her when she seemed
about to faint. He had scarce begun to pencil his
message on a blank leaf, when Prudence looked in
at the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, ’tis here your honour is, sir; and sure
I’m sorry you’re going away so suddent,” she said,
advancing. “When Caleb told me just now, I
couldn’t believe my ears, and I wouldn’t yet, neither,
if I didn’t see your cloak and bag, more’s the
pity.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I am going,” said Everell, handing her
the reward of merit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh lor, sir, what princely generosity! I’m
sure I aren’t no ways deserving of such! It reely
breaks my heart, begging your Honour’s pardon,
to see how things have come about. After all that’s
took place this past week, to hear of this marriage—’tis
enough to make one think of witchcraft—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This marriage? What marriage?—whose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, this here marriage, in course. Bean’t
that what sends your Honour away all of a suddent
at such a time o’ night?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whose marriage? Speak, Prudence!—in a
word, whose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, mistress’s marriage, to be sure. Whose
else in the world—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mistress’s mar—! What mistress?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mistress Georgiana Foxwell, in course: I don’t
own to no other mistress, I’m sure.” The maid
drew back from Everell, wondering if the loss of
his sweetheart had affected his wits.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mistress Georgiana! Are you mad, Prudence?
What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mad, sir? Not me! I scorn the word. ’Tis
my betters I takes to be mad, to go and make a
match of it with a gentleman she’s scarce set eyes
on, be he ever so rich.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What gentleman do you speak of? Truly I
think you <i>are</i> mad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m a-speaking of Squire Thornby, sir, who
but he? Sure then, haven’t they told your Honour?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Squire Thornby?” repeated Everell, with but
vague recollection of the little he had heard of that
person. “A neighbour of Mr. Foxwell’s, isn’t
he?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, with a large estate, I’ve heard say. ’Tis
all I know of him, barring they’ve arranged he shall
marry my mistress; though that’s quite enough,
heavens knows, and you could have knocked me
down with a feather when I heard as much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But ’tis impossible! They little know her: let
them arrange as they will, she will never consent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, sir, but that’s the strangest part of it;
for didn’t I hear her consent in this very room,
with these ears, not ten minutes ago? ‘Excep’
Squire Thornby’s proposal of marriage,’ them was
her uncle’s words, and she said yes, and Lady
Strange is with her now, a-tellin’ how adventidjus
a match ’twill be. And if you think a poor waiting-woman’s
word can’t be took, you’re free to go and
ask for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Marry Squire Thornby!—after all that has
passed—her grief at my going—her appeal for
my life! It can’t be; I’ll not believe it, unless she
tells me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He went swiftly from the room, and ran up the
stairs. Before he had time to reflect upon the impulse
he obeyed, he was on the landing outside her
antechamber, calling through the closed door:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Georgiana!—my love! Come and deny this
slander! Come, let me hear the truth!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The door opened, and Georgiana appeared, pale
and sorrow-stricken. Lady Strange was at her side,
with a gently restraining touch upon her arm. But
Everell seized the girl’s hand and led her down the
stairs, partly as if he claimed her from any other’s
possession, and partly that he might see her face
in the better light of the hall below. “Sweet, what
blundering tale is this?” he asked, as they descended;—“of
a marriage with Squire Thornby,
and that you have given your consent?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana was silent, with averted glance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why don’t you answer?” he said, as they
reached the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>She lifted her eyes to his, but could not bring
her lips to frame a word.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What!” he exclaimed; “’tis true, then?
Oh!”</p>

<p class='c012'>His cry was like that of sharp pain; he dropped
her hand, and walked a few steps from her. “Who
would have believed it?” he said, plaintively; “I
would have staked my soul upon it that you loved
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Loved you!” she said, in a faint whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what can it mean, then?” he asked,
touched alike by her words and her look. “Surely
you don’t put wealth and convenience before love?
Do you fear I may never come back to you? And
to give your consent at such a time—but ten minutes
ago, the maid says! Why, you had just been
pleading for my life.—Ah! now I understand!—blind
fool that I’ve been, not to see at once! forgive
me, dearest love! ’Tis your uncle’s doing:
he has sold you my life for your consent to the
marriage!” With that, Everell grasped her hand,
and started toward the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hush, Everell!” said Georgiana, fearful lest
all might be undone; “go, for heaven’s sake, for
my sake, ere it be too late!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Fortunately Caleb had stepped out to the courtyard
to gossip with his fellow servant who had
opened the gate, and, as the house door was but
slightly ajar, there were no witnesses to what was
passing in the hall, save Lady Strange and Prudence,
who had both followed down the stairs.
Holding back from the dining-room door, Georgiana
still begged Everell to go.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go, on those terms?” he said. “Not I!
Rather die the worst of deaths. Let you marry
another? I’ll give myself up first!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, Everell—my love—I implore—on my
knees! Must I plead with you as I pleaded
with my uncle? You should know I cannot endure
the thought of your death. Only that you
live, that is enough! Go, I beseech!—let not my
sacrifice be in vain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You sha’n’t make the sacrifice,” he said, fiercely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis made already: my uncle has my promise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your uncle!—where is he?” And Everell
strode into the dining-room, followed by the three
women. Before he had time to reach the drawing-room
door, it was opened from the other side, and
Everell had no farther to go to meet Foxwell, who
had heard the young man’s loud-spoken words. At
sight of Georgiana, her uncle made an ejaculation,
and advanced toward Everell with a resentful look:
he held in one hand a pen, in the other the letter
which the sound of Everell’s voice had interrupted;
and this time both Mrs. Winter and Rashleigh took
the liberty of intruding upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, you come in good time!” cried Everell.
“I refuse my liberty at the price you set. She shall
not marry another to save me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis too late, sir,” said Foxwell, with forced
quietness; “she has already bound herself by her
promise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then give her back her promise, as I give
myself back to you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pardon me, but you have no part in the covenant:
’tis between my niece and myself—your
liberty for her promise. Even were she inclined to
cancel the agreement, she cannot do so now: I have
given your liberty, have performed my part: she
is bound by her promise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see ’tis too late, Everell,” said Georgiana,
in whom every other feeling yielded to anxiety for
his safety; “you cannot mend matters now. Save
yourself—at least that!—for my sake!”</p>

<p class='c012'>For a moment her lover was thoughtful. He
threw back his cloak at both shoulders, so that it
hung behind him. To enforce her plea, Georgiana
laid her hand upon his arm: she stepped forward
so that she now stood beside him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But <i>I</i> am not bound by her promise,” said
Everell to Foxwell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are no longer bound by anything, sir, to
me,” Foxwell replied. “If you insist upon staying
in this neighbourhood, ’tis at your own peril.
And I warrant you ’twill avail nothing: I shall see
that my niece neither leaves her apartments, nor
communicates with any one outside them, until her
marriage; you force me to that use of my authority.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Before Everell could answer, a voice was heard
in the hall doorway behind him—Caleb’s voice, addressed
to Foxwell: “Please, your Honour, Joseph
has the horse ready, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The word “horse” shot through the confusion
of Everell’s thoughts.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell Joseph to wait,” said Foxwell, glancing
at the unfinished letter in his hand. Everell heard
Caleb walk away through the hall to the house
door. He knew there was a mounting-block at the
side of that door: would Joseph let the horse wait
there, or walk it up and down the courtyard?
“And now again, Mr. Everell,” resumed Foxwell,
“I bid you farewell; and I beg that this leave-taking
may be final.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell drew a deep breath; then replied: “I
am willing it shall be final, sir. But one word
before I go. I have pondered what you have said:
’tis clear I am no longer bound to you by any obligation:
as for your niece, I am not bound by
her promise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I grant you,” replied Foxwell, “’tis for her
alone to keep that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if I should prevent her keeping it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis not possible; or, if so, not to a man of
honour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not, pray? I am answerable only for
my own promises. She is bound by hers, and will
keep it—if she can. But if I prevent her, by force,
she’ll not be to blame for that. There will be no
breach of honour then.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must end this, sir.—To cross another’s
promise is no better than to break one’s own—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not in this case, sir,” replied Everell, his voice
rising in spite of himself, as his heart rose to the
wild attempt he was about to make—rashness had
brought him to this pass, let rashness bring him
out!—“not in this case, for the promise concerns
me, yet I was not consulted in its making—there’s
reason for you! As for possibility, let’s put it to
the test! Prevent her? Yes!” He had half-drawn
his sword, but he quickly slid it back; flung
his arms around Georgiana’s waist, and, lifting her
high, made a dash for the hall, passing between
Lady Strange and Prudence on the way; ran on
out to the courtyard, where, by a lantern in Joseph’s
hand, he saw the horse at the mounting-block;
thanks to which, he gained the saddle in
two steps, with the slight form of Georgiana still
in his arms; jerked the bridle from Joseph’s hold
ere the groom or the two other servants knew what
was happening; applied the spurs, and was off at
a gallop through the open gateway before Foxwell
had got as far as to the house door in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell had lost no more time through sheer
astonishment than most men would have lost. But,
as he started to go after Everell, the maid Prudence
also started, apparently upon the impulse of
concern for her mistress: being nearer the doorway,
she arrived first; tripped at the threshold,
and dropped on all fours, filling up the opening so
that Foxwell was delayed for some seconds ere he
could pass to the hall. He had hope that the servants
about the house door would stop the fugitive;
but they were taken by surprise, they knew that
Everell was to leave, and they did not know for
what purpose the horse had been got ready. So
now the lover, with his prize in his arms, was galloping
away in the darkness. Foxwell ordered two
horses saddled, and sent Caleb to listen as to which
direction the fugitive was taking.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>ROADS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>For</span> the first few moments, Everell left matters to
the horse, merely keeping the rein in hand while he
adjusted his burden so that Georgiana might be as
free from discomfort as necessity allowed. He
dared not trust to placing her behind him, as if she
had been a consenting partner in his flight. For
the time being, she must remain prisoned between
his arms. He worked his body as far back on the
horse as agreed with his sure control of the animal,
thus giving Georgiana the benefit of the saddle:
he could dispense with stirrups. The horse plunged
wildly down the slope, finding the unbarred opening
at the bottom rather by its own sense than by
Everell’s guidance.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sky was black with clouds, but by the time he
had thus gained the road, the young gentleman had
become sufficiently used to the darkness to make
out something of his way ahead. He was at an
instant’s hesitation as to which way he should turn.
Remembering that Foxwell had advised him to go
by Burndale, and might suppose this advice taken,
he decided for the other—in itself less safe—direction.
So he reined his steed toward the village,
as was presently advertised to the listening Caleb
by the thump of hoofs on the bridge. At the entrance
to the village, there was again choice of two
ways. The road ahead, passing the public-house,
led to the town at which Everell had first met
Georgiana. As he now recalled, it passed in sight of
Thornby Hall. The other road, turning off at the
right and skirting the churchyard, eventually arrived
at the great highway for London some miles farther
south than the first road: so the ale-house keeper
had told Everell. For more than one reason, then,
it seemed preferable. The ale-house keeper had not
mentioned, however, that this road was in great
part little used and much neglected; nor did it
occur to Everell at the moment that some such
consideration must have made the Foxwells use the
other road in returning from the South.</p>

<p class='c012'>The young man, then, turned to the right, and,
passing the church, quickly left the village behind.
He had not met a soul, nor heard a human sound:
doubtless people kept within doors on account of
the nipping air; as for noise, most of the habitual
producers thereof were probably at the ale-house.
Presently the way bent to the left, and seemed for
awhile to run nearly parallel to the other road.
Everell felt Georgiana shiver slightly in his arms.
He stopped his horse, and, hearing no sound as of
anybody in pursuit, he undid his cloak and contrived
to wrap it around her. He then set forward
again, though at a less mad pace.</p>

<p class='c012'>In all this time Georgiana had not uttered a
word; nor Everell to her, his only exclamations
having been addressed to the horse. What were
her feelings? We know that she was being carried
away by force, in a dress certainly not designed for
travel on a cold and dark night, and without
bag or baggage; carried away on horseback, without
her consent, by a reckless young gentleman
whose neck was now doubly in danger—nay, trebly
so, for at that time abduction and horse-stealing
were both hanging matters, no less than treason;
carried away by sheer strength of arm, even as
any Sabine or other woman who ever underwent
the experience of marriage by capture; carried
away unceremoniously and suddenly—but by the
man she loved! Was she entirely shocked, indignant,
and terrified? Let us leave it to the imagination
of other young ladies of her age—and perhaps
of young ladies a few years older.  Whatever
Georgiana’s feelings may have been, they were constantly
mingled with the questions, “What next?
Where now? What is he going to do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell was proposing to himself that same riddle.
He wondered what he <i>was</i> going to do. For the
present, the only thing was to push on. Not until
a considerable distance lay between him and Foxwell
Court would he dare seek shelter. How long could
Georgiana endure the cold and fatigue? How long
could the horse travel? No doubt a stop must needs
be made during the night, at some village inn or
farmhouse, where a plausible story would have to
be told in order to account for their situation and to
obtain admittance—a story of the lady being
robbed and left for dead by the roadside, and found
there by her present custodian; or some such tale.
Would Georgiana deny his account, and seek to
frustrate him, as in honesty she ought to do? He
must prevent that by dire threats, must enforce her
to silence upon penalties of wholesale disaster, so
that she must feel bound by every womanly fear,
by conscience itself, to avert the greater evil of
tragedy to all concerned, by obeying his commands.
She must be in terror of him, and of the consequences
of resisting his will. If he frightened and
offended her, he must hope to make his peace and
atonement later.  Would she really need such
thorough intimidation? would not mere formal
compulsion suffice—such as might serve as a
woman’s excuse for not making the protest that
strict duty required? He could not be sure, and
he dared not ask her: he resolved to take no risks;
she should have ample reason to feel justified in non-resistance.
But should all his commands and
menaces not avail?—would he make good his
threats? He knew not: so far, he could only hope
the occasion would not arise.</p>

<p class='c012'>So much for his course with regard to Georgiana’s
possible opposition. Wherever they should stop, he
would allow her no chance of speaking to anybody
out of his presence: when she slept, not even a maid
should have access to her room, and he himself
would rest outside her door, with the key in his
pocket. At the first town they should enter on the
morrow, he would take measures to supply her with
the necessaries she now lacked; he would have to
provide a few things for himself also, for he had left
his cloak-bag at Foxwell Court. At the same town,
he would abandon the horse, and hire a post-chaise
for the continuance of their journey. His ultimate
aim must be, to reach the small seaport to which
Roughwood had gone before him, and thence be
conveyed with Georgiana to France. Whether circumstances
would permit him to make her his wife
on their Southward journey, he could not know; if
not, the ceremony should be his first concern upon
setting foot in France.</p>

<p class='c012'>So the future took general form in his thoughts
as he rode. But meanwhile, only the first step had
been made. A thousand difficulties, a thousand
dangers, stood in the way. He saw himself at
the beginning of a long and toilsome business, which
would make incessant demands upon his wit, resolution,
and endurance. He could allow himself
little time for rest. All depended upon his retaining
the start he had gained; upon his keeping ever
ahead of the pursuit that would be made, and of
the news which, spreading in all directions, would
follow close upon his heels. He now thanked his
impulse for having led him into this road. If Foxwell
had set out as soon as horse could be saddled,
he must lose much time by taking the wrong road,
which Everell, still hearing nothing behind, assumed
that he would surely do.</p>

<p class='c012'>But this advantage, if it really existed, might be
more than offset ere all was done. A sudden sharp
sense of this caused Everell to urge the horse to its
former pace. The animal responded readily enough;
sped most gallantly for a furlong or so; then, without
any warning, stumbled upon its knees, almost
throwing the riders. It rose trembling, and started
to go on—but with a limp that made Everell’s
heart sink within him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Curse upon the bad road! The horse is lamed—hopelessly!
Poor beast! brave fellow, he would
bear us still in spite of his pain! Well, he can serve
us no more to-night! There’s nothing for it but
going afoot till I can get another mount.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He lifted Georgiana from the saddle, threw his
leg over it, and slid with her to the ground. For
a few moments he let her stand, but kept one arm
around her, while he looked up and down the road
in search of a habitation. But the darkness baffled
him. He remembered having passed a few scattered
cottages, but the nearest was a good way back.
He was likely to find a house sooner by
going ahead, which seemed on other accounts the
better course. As for the poor steed, Everell was
first of a mind to leave it to its will; but he feared
it might thus serve to inform his pursuers of his
enforced delay in the neighbourhood, and cause
more particular search to be made near at hand.
Retaining the halter in his grasp, and taking up
Georgiana so as to carry her as one carries a child
in long clothes, he started forward. He hoped he
might discover a house before the young lady’s
weight became too much for him; in other case,
he must subject her lightly shod feet to contact
with the rough road. Fortunately, he soon beheld
a light, which by its steadiness and position he
judged to belong to a house not far ahead, on higher
ground, a little way back from the left-hand side
of the road. Everell stopped, and again set Georgiana
on her feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know whose house that is?” he asked,
curtly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” she replied, in the lowest audible voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good,” said he. “From its situation I think it
may be a gentleman’s. At all events, I intend to
borrow a horse there—perhaps a pair of horses,
or—who knows?—a chaise and pair. I shall tell
what story I see fit; and you will say nothing—or
at most a mere yes or no to confirm my account.
You are under my compulsion, which I am ready to
enforce by desperate acts. Remember, my life is
not worth a farthing, in the eye of the law; nothing
more that I may do can add to the fate I have
already incurred; so if all’s lost I’m determined to
stop at nothing. I warn you then, once and for all,
attempt not to thwart me in the slightest matter,
unless you wish to bring down such a catastrophe
as you dare not even imagine. You are not to quit
my side unless at my command. It may be, your
face is known to the people we shall see in that
house: you must have been closely observed the
day you appeared at church. So I must bid you take
your neckerchief and veil your face with it—I’ll
tie it myself when you have it arranged. And you
will on no account remove it—nor the cloak, either,
which hides your figure. For all this concealment
and silence, I shall contrive to account. All depends
on whom I have to deal with yonder; till I see what
manner of person, I know not what tale I must
invent. Whatever you find it, you will support it
by silence and obedience. Bear in mind, you are
not your own mistress: you are under my enforcement.
If evil come of your obedience, the consequences
will be upon my head; but ’tis nothing to
the evil that will come if you disobey. So beware,
then, of causing such disaster as I will not even
speak of!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He then fastened behind her head the neck-handkerchief,
which she had already begun, with slow
and trembling fingers, to adjust over her face.
Taking this compliance as a sign of submission,
he next arranged his cloak more carefully around
her, clasped her once more in his arms, and walked
on, leading the horse, till he arrived at a small cottage
which manifestly served as lodge to the house
from which the light shone. The gate was closed,
but from between its tall pickets Everell could make
out an avenue of tall trees leading up to the mansion.
He knocked and halloed, and presently a man, half-dressed,
carrying a lantern, came out of the lodge
and inspected him through the gate.</p>

<p class='c012'>It occurred to Everell that he had best speak, at
this stage, as if he were a friend, or at least an
acquaintance, of the master of the house: he was
thus more likely to obtain prompt admittance, and,
secondly, he might thus better secure the gatekeeper
against betraying him to the inquiries of pursuers.
Upon this later point, moreover, he took a grain of
comfort from the fact that Foxwell was not liked
by the gentry in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is your master at home?” he said. “We have
met with an accident. Pray do not keep us waiting
in the cold—the lady is shivering. We have had
to leave a horse behind, and this one is quite lame.
’Tis lucky we were so near a friend’s. Come, my
good fellow, open quickly!—this lady must be got
indoors—your master is at home, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir, he’s at home,” said the fellow, and
dubiously scratched his head. “As to opening the
gate at this time of night, why, if your Honour will
but let me take your name to master, I make no
doubt—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rascal! Dare you think of keeping us here to
freeze? Names, say you?—dog, if you but knew
our names!—knew whom you are delaying!—or
if your master knew! Open at once, I command
you, and lead us to your master, or bitterly you’ll
rue it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The imperiousness of the manner exceeded even
that of the words. The man, convinced that the
speaker was some great person whom his master
would be fearful of offending, opened the gate
with much bowing and apology.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now shut the gate,” ordered Everell, when he
and his company had entered. “And if any one
comes inquiring for a lady and gentleman on horseback,
say you know nothing of them. Remember
that. And have the horse taken care of.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Emphasizing his commands with a coin, and letting
Georgiana walk beside him, Everell proceeded
up the avenue, the gatekeeper leading the horse.
The mansion proved to be a large house in the
square-built style nowadays called Georgian. Arriving
before the great central door, the guide
summoned a rustic-looking footman, to whom he
resigned the visitors with a whispered recommendation
that caused them to be received with as much
respect as surprise. Their appearance was indeed
sufficient cause for the latter, Everell still having
an arm clasped around Georgiana in her masculine
cloak and improvised veil.</p>

<p class='c012'>They found themselves in a dimly lighted hall,
at the farther end of which was a door matching
that by which they had entered. There was the
stairway usual to such houses, beginning along one
side of the hall, crossing at the end, and finishing
the ascent along the other side in the return direction.
Having closed the door, the servant asked
by what name he might announce my lord and her
ladyship to his master.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell him a gentleman and lady,” said Everell,
“who are in great haste, and will not trouble him
long.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A gentleman and lady, sir,” repeated the servant,
obediently. “Begging your lordship’s pardon,
but master, being in his cups, may wish to know—I
mean to say, master is main hard to draw from
his comforts at this time o’ night—though I dare
say when I tell him you be friends of his—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Friends? Certainly—unless I am mistaken
as to the house. But that’s easily set right:—who
is your master?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Squire Thornby, sir; and this house is
Thornby Hall.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From Everell’s look, the servant concluded that
the gentleman probably <i>was</i> mistaken as to the
house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how can that be?” cried Everell. “Thornby
Hall is on the other road.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis on both roads, so to speak, sir. The two
run near together just hereaways; the house looks
on each. There’s two gates, you know, sir, and two
lodges; the gardener lives in one, and Jenkins in
t’other.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell took a moment’s thought. Resolution
appeared on his face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis just as well,” he said. “Mr. Thornby is
known to me by reputation. Tell him I am here,
and must needs beg he will see me without delay.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was spoken with such an air that the servant
conceived it best to carry the message at once, without
a second attempt to elicit the speaker’s name. As
soon as the man was gone, Everell said to Georgiana:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must brave it out with this Squire Thornby,
there’s nothing else for it. We must have horses,
and soon: ’twere folly to go on afoot, heaven knows
how far, till we found another house. As well
solicit this gentleman’s help as another’s—’tis all
one, he may be no harder to persuade. He has
never seen me, and now he shall not see you. Take
good heed you don’t show your face, nor shift the
cloak, nor let your voice be heard: or ’twill go
ill, I promise you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana made no answer, nor gave any sign
of existence save to draw a long breath. Was it of
helpless resignation to the compulsion she was
under? was it to brace herself for resistance to
that compulsion? or to steady herself against
anxiety as to the outcome? Did she really see
through his show of dark threat? Was her scrupulosity
of conscience so great, that so much intimidation
was required to keep her from opposing her
abductor, in the interests alike of her given promise
and of maidenly propriety? Oh, woman, woman!—</p>

<p class='c012'>The footman returned with word that his master
would attend upon the visitors in a minute; and
showed them into a large room, which appeared, by
the candles he lighted, to be devoted to the exercise
of his master’s functions as justice of the peace.
Near one end was a large table whereon were an
inkstand, pens, and a few weighty-looking books.
The walls were paneled in oak, and the bare floor
was of the same wood. There were two armchairs
drawn up to the table, and two before the fireplace,
while oak settles stood against the wall. The servant
fanned the smouldering fire into a blaze, put
on a fresh log, and left the apartment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell had been looking at a door in the side of
the room, near the table. It was slightly ajar, and
its key was in place,—two indications that it
sheltered no secret. As soon as he and Georgiana
were alone, Everell led her hastily to it, and, throwing
it open, discovered a large closet containing a
disorderly array of shabby cloaks, wigs, whips,
hats and such, on pegs; and old record books piled
in a corner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis none so roomy, but ’twill do at a pinch,”
said Everell. “I think it best you should be out of
sight altogether, miss. I can tell my story better.
I must command you to enter.” And he gently
pushed her into the closet. “Do not dare to cry
out; and when I open the door to fetch you, be
veiled, cloaked, and silent, as you are now. Remember!—or
injury will be done.—Stay, those books
will serve you to sit on—you will be tired standing.”
He guided her to the pile of old volumes,
and then came out of the closet, and locked the door.
The key, long unused save as a door handle, turned
hardly, and he had difficulty in getting it from the
lock in order to pocket it. As he was in the act of
drawing it out, a heavy step made him glance
around. He beheld a robust-looking man with a
red face, who stood regarding him with pugnacious
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your servant, sir,” said Everell, with an easy
bow. “Mr. Thornby, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s my name, sir,” said the Squire, bluntly.
“Might I ask what you’re doing at that there
closet door, sir?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Closet door, sir?” repeated Everell, lightly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only locking it, sir,—that’s all.” And he held
up the key as evidence of the truth of his assertion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And perhaps I have a right to know what the
devil you’re a-locking it for? Who asked you for
to lock my doors, sir? Ecod, I must say this is rare
manners in a stranger. I don’t remember as how
I ever had the honour of seeing your face afore,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis quite true we have never met before, sir.
The loss has been mine,” said Everell, resting upon
courtesy till he could see how best to deal with his
man. At the same time, he carelessly pocketed the
key.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you trying to put a game on me, sir?”
said Thornby, wrathfully. Though he had evidently
been called from his bottle, he was in full possession
both of his legs and of his usual wits. “Look
ye, ’tis mighty suspicious, poking your nose into my
closets. I have a shrewd guess what you came into
my house for—passing yourself off as a lord to my
fool servants. And the lady?—I don’t see any
lady here!—ecod, perhaps she’s poking her nose
into the silver closet! Hey, Jabez, the plate!”
With that, the Squire started for the door by which
he had entered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, sir, you wrong us!” cried Everell, striding
to intercept him. “The lady is in that closet—I
took the liberty—she desires not to be seen.
Upon my honour, sir, we had no purpose in entering
your house but to ask your aid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thornby, having been stayed by Everell’s first
declaration, gazed at the closet and then at the
young gentleman. “But what the devil does the
lady please to hide in a closet for?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She desires not to be seen, as I tell you.
’Twas the nearest place of concealment. I locked
the door lest you might open it before I could
explain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And why doesn’t she desire to be seen? ’Tis
the first of her sex afflicted that way, as ever I
heard on. Is there aught the matter wi’ her looks?
Ecod, what o’ that? There’s a plenty in the same
boat amongst the she-folk hereabouts. There’s only
one beauty in these four parishes, if I be any
judge.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis for no such reason,” said Everell, with a
smile, as he began to see his way. “Sir, I perceive
you’re a blunt, outspoken gentleman, given to
plain dealing yourself, and no doubt preferring it in
others. I’m resolved to throw myself on your confidence,
as far as I think safe, and tell you my story,
or as much as I dare. Perhaps then your fellow-feeling—for
your words imply a gallant sense of
beauty in the tender sex—may impel you to assist
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“H’m!” ejaculated the Squire, dubiously, though
his relaxed countenance showed him to be decidedly
mollified. “Perhaps—and then again, perhaps
not. Let’s hear your story, howsomever. ’Tis all
devilish curious—the lady desiring not to be seen,
and the rest of it. Please to take this here chair.”
The Squire moved an armchair from what was
evidently the clerk’s place to where it faced across
the table to the seat of judgment. He then went
around and assumed the latter, having meanwhile
rung for a servant. “And just to be on the safe
side,” he added, “in case it <i>is</i> a game you’re a-trying
on, I’ll be prepared.” He drew a bunch of small
keys from his pocket, opened a drawer in his side
of the table, and fetched out a pair of pistols, which
he laid before him; he then closed the drawer, all
but a few inches. “Yes, sir, I keep ’em always
loaded,” he said, as he looked to the priming. “I’m
a blunt, outspoken man, as you observe, and I take
my precautions.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have no right to complain, sir,” said Everell,
who sat with his face to the Squire, and his back
to the door of the apartment; “a stranger intruding
at this hour of the night must take what reception
he finds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well said, sir. And at the same time I’ll
show you as I know how to treat a gentleman, too,
in case you be one.—Jabez,” for the servant had
now entered, “tell Bartholomew to fetch a bottle
of what I’ve been drinking. And tell the gentlemen
at table—no, they bean’t gentlemen neither, and
damn me if I’ll call ’em so!—tell ’em to make the
best of it without me, I’ll be with ’em when I see fit.—A
man is hard put to it for proper company
sometimes, sir,” he explained, when Jabez had gone.
“Though if some beggarly attorney, or worse, can
do justice to his bottle, and tell a good tale or so,
talk intelligently of dogs and horses, and listen with
respect to his betters, why, some things may be
winked at.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was manifestly Thornby’s wish to postpone
matters till the wine came; so Everell answered in
the strain he thought likely to command the other’s
favour. Bartholomew presently appeared with
bottle and glasses, observed the pistols with mild
wonder, and retired.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, sir,” said Thornby, “we’ll drink the lady’s
health, and then for your business. Nay, don’t
trouble yourself to reach; keep to your own side
of the table.” And the Squire pushed bottle and
glass to Everell’s hands, preferring that these should
not come too close to the pistols. “The lady’s
health, as I said.  Shall we have her name,
sir?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not at present, if you’ll excuse me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As you please. Health of the fair unknown
in the closet—eh?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The fair unknown in the closet,” said Everell,
and the glasses went to the lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now, by the Lord,” said the Squire, “you
shall return the compliment. I’ve drunk to your
fair companion: you shall drink to a lady of my
proposing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“With all my heart,” replied Everell, and dissembled
his impatience while the glasses were filled
anew.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir,” said Thornby, “a lady of my proposing:
the beauty of the four parishes—nay, the
beauty of the county—damme, I may as well say
the beauty of England! I’ll give her name, too:
there’s no reason, as I know of, for to keep it back.
To Miss Georgiana Foxwell!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Miss Georgiana Foxwell,” echoed Everell,
wondering, as he drank, whether she could hear
herself thus twice honoured in so short a time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose you never saw that young lady I
proposed, sir,” said Thornby, as he put down his
glass and resumed his seat, for the toasts had been
drunk standing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am a stranger in this part of England, sir,”
Everell answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I take you for a town-bred man. Maybe, then,
you’ve met an uncle of hers in London aforetime—one
Mr. Robert Foxwell?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I <i>have</i> met a Mr. Robert Foxwell—but I cannot
truly say I know much of him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The less the better, if truth must be told; he’s
a damned supercilious fop! A rogue, too. He
hates me like poison, but, for all that, he’ll let me
marry his niece.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How so, if he hates you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because,” said Thornby, tapping the drawer of
the table with his fingers, “I have that in my possession
which makes him consider my wishes. Yes,
sir,” and he thrust his hand carelessly into the
drawer, till Everell heard a rustle of papers, “I
hold the means of keeping Mr. Robert Foxwell in
his place. But that’s neither here nor there. Let’s
hear your petition, friend; and you might begin
with your name, which I don’t remember as how
you’ve yet mentioned.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I would rather finish than begin with it,” said
Everell, “if, when you’ve heard me, you still require
it. You may not wish in the future to admit having
helped me: if you remain ignorant of my name,
you can never be sure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis by no means certain that I <i>shall</i> help you,”
declared the Squire, bluntly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have good hopes of you,” said Everell.
“Frankly, sir, I am running away with that lady.”
Thornby stared and blinked; finally threw back his
head and laughed loudly. “Oho, that’s how the
wind sits, eh? Ecod, I might ’a’ guessed as much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are a man of spirit, with an eye for beauty,”
Everell went on rapidly: “therefore you will not
blame me. I love her, she loves me; but her nearest
relation wishes her to marry another—one
whom she does not love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Devil take her nearest relation!” said Thornby.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Amen! He has so worked upon her mind, by
threats of ill consequences to me, as to obtain her
consent to marry this other gentleman, much against
the dictates of her heart. She is a lady who, having
once given her promise, would fulfil it: she was thus
barred from eloping with me of her own will.
What then was I to do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ecod, sir,” Thornby replied, heartily, “you was
to take matters in hand, and carry her away, of
<i>your</i> own will!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Precisely what I have done, sir! I knew I
could rely upon your approval.—Well, sir, I
seized her under her guardian’s very nose, set her
upon a horse that stood waiting, mounted behind
her, and was away at a gallop before anybody had
the wit to stop me. I made what speed I could, over
roads unknown to me; how far we have ridden,
what adventures we have had, I beg you will excuse
me from relating. So far, no pursuit has come
within sight or hearing: though, if her relation
was prompt, he need have lost no time but to saddle
his horses. Our own beast, which kind fortune
had placed ready to my hand, at last broke down;
but within a short distance of your gate, which I
take as another circumstance of fortune’s favour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s as how it may be,” said the Squire, who
had followed the lover’s recital with lively interest.
“But first I’d give something to know who ’tis
you’ve—ha, ha!—carried off. Ecod, perhaps
’tisn’t the first time a woman has been carried off
against her will but not against her wish! Who
is it, man?—come, who is the lady?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I beg you will not insist upon knowing just
now. Doubtless the news will travel all too soon.
Meanwhile I would have your help without a
scruple. Should you be acquainted with her family,
you might feel bound to cross my purpose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thornby, after a moment’s thought, admitted
there was something in that. Still, “I wonder who
it can be:—how far do you say you’ve rid?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do not say,” replied Everell, smiling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s Miss Hollowfield,” mused Thornby,
aloud; “her grandfather’d be opposed to a stripling
like you—but nobody’d run away with such
a face as hers. And there’s Miss Marvell—why,
I’ll wager ’tis Dick Birch they want to marry her
to. Sukey Marvell, that’s who ’tis.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must not tell,” said Everell, shaking his head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, ’tis Sukey,” declared Thornby: “well,
she’s not as bad as t’other. And old Dick Birch,
I’ll be glad to see him done out of her!—damned
coxcomb! serves him right for the trick he played
me at York races. Oh, I’ll have the laugh on Dick
next time we meet!—I’ll have him here for some
shooting, a-purpose. Ha, ha! These conceited fellows
think they can marry any pretty girl they
set their minds on. Well, young sir, I wish you
joy. I’ve owed Dick Birch a grudge these many
months.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The favour I have to ask,” said Everell, “is the
loan of a chaise, with horses and a man, to the
nearest town from which I can travel on by post.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, damn me, that’s not so much to ask,
neither,” said Thornby, still vastly good-humoured
over the discomfiture of Dick Birch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thank you from my heart. And, as every
minute counts, I hope I may be set on my way as
soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“H’m!—many a man, sir, would think twice
afore sending out his horses—but I don’t want
to spoil sport. In for a penny, in for a pound.
I’ll give orders; and meanwhile my housekeeper
can show Sukey to the guest-chamber—she may
like to make herself trim in front of a glass—you
know the ways o’ that sex—while the horses are
being put to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A thousand thanks, but I daren’t allow the lady
so far out of my control. She may be shown to a
room, if she will; but the room must have but
one door, and I must wait outside that door. Pray
bear in mind, she is travelling under compulsion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Compulsion!—oh, certainly—ha, ha! I’ll
send for Mrs. Jenkins, and for old Rodge; he shall
drive you—’twill need a careful man with the
horses.” Thornby, who had risen from the table,
pulled the bell-cord. “And meanwhile we’ll drink
confusion to Dick Birch. Dod, to see him bubbled
out of a bride this way!—it does one’s heart good!
But, man, we’d better let Sukey out o’ that closet,
now ’tis all settled. Come, you’ve got the key:
unlock, unlock.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But there must be a condition: you’ll not ask
the lady to uncover her face: she must still remain
unknown.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, be it so: let Sukey remain unknown; it
may save me trouble, to be sure. But let her out,
let her out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell unlocked the door, and, peering in before
he opened it wide, saw that Georgiana was still
cloaked and veiled. He led her forth with a whispered
“Remember!—not a word!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your humble servant, ma’am,” said Thornby,
bowing with all the elegance at his command.</p>

<p class='c012'>Before there was time for either speech or silence,
a noise of steps and voices arose outside the apartment.
Thornby turned, with a look of wrath at the
interruption, toward the door. It was flung open,
and a man in cloak and riding-boots walked in,
followed by a servant of his own, and by the footman
Jabez.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To horse, Thornby! we must scour the country!”
cried the newcomer as he hastily approached.
His glance now fell upon Everell and Georgiana,
and of a sudden he stopped short, with an ejaculation
of surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s the matter, Foxwell?” inquired
Thornby. “Why d’ye stare like that?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c007'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>PISTOLS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Thornby’s</span> words indicated surprise at Foxwell’s
surprise. Foxwell shot a keen glance to see if the
other’s surprise was genuine. There could be no
doubt of that. This occasioned new surprise in
Foxwell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Egad, sir,” said he, “I should think I might
be pardoned for staring. How come they to be
here? It puzzles me, I own.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who here?” blurted Thornby. “This gentleman
and lady, d’ye mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, the gentleman and lady I’ve been in search
of.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, you don’t desire to stop ’em, do you?
What the deuce is little Sue Marvell to you?—and
Dick Birch? Captain Marvell is no friend of
yours. Rather help these young people away, if
only for the joke on Dick Birch.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of what are you talking?” cried Foxwell.
“Can it be possible you don’t know who these young
people are?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know much of the gentleman,” Thornby
admitted; “but the girl is Sukey Marvell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sukey Marvell!—Sukey devil!” exclaimed
Foxwell, and, striding up to Georgiana, he snatched
the handkerchief from her face. Everell had left
her standing at the end of the table, himself having
moved around to Thornby’s former place a moment
earlier for a purpose of his own. Checking an
impulse to go to Georgiana’s side, he now stood
between the magisterial chair and the table. Despite
all that was at stake, he was amused at the sight of
Thornby gazing with mouth wide open at the face
so unexpectedly revealed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It seems <i>you</i> find reason to stare now,” said
Foxwell to the Squire. “Egad, Thornby, had they
bamboozled you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Thornby, I hold you to your promise,”
Everell put in; “a chaise, horses, and a man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Chaise, horses, and damnation!” was the reply
of Thornby, as he at last found a voice. “I never
knew ’twas <i>she</i> you was a-running away with. You
said ’twas Sukey Marvell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pardon me, no; <i>you</i> said ’twas Sukey Marvell.
And I hold you to your promise.”</p>

<div id='i313'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i313.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“HE SNATCHED THE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HER FACE.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hold and be damned!—And Foxwell, you’ve
deceived me, too. You said you’d persuade her to
have me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So I have done,” asserted Foxwell, “and she
has given her consent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Given her consent? Then <i>you</i> was the relation—and
<i>I’m</i> the Dick Birch! What?—and this
here stripling would ’a’ had me help to do myself
out of a bride! Oh, you shall all pay for this among
you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Softly, softly, Thornby,” said Foxwell. “She
has promised to marry you. Have you not, miss?”</p>

<p class='c012'>After a brief hesitation, Georgiana uttered a
reluctant “yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you forced the promise from her,” said
Thornby.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She gave it willingly,” returned Foxwell. “Did
you not, miss?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—willingly,” said Georgiana, in the faintest
of voices.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And yet you ran away with this here other
man,” said Thornby.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was—carried away,” she replied, in a tone
as frail as before.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you are still willing to marry Mr.
Thornby?” said her uncle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Y—yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thornby’s brow cleared. “Then, ecod, not much
harm’s done, after all. ’Tis all well that ends
well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell again put in, addressing Thornby: “She
is willing to marry you, perhaps. But ask her if
she will ever love you, man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eh! Well, what about that? D’ye think you’ll
ever love me, miss?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, I do not, sir,” cried Georgiana, suddenly
emphatic of voice. “I shall always love this gentleman!
For ever, and ever, and ever!” And she
moved toward the man of her choice.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her manner of speech, her look of disdain, and
Everell’s smile of triumph were too much for
Thornby’s savage vanity. “Then don’t flatter yourself
I’ll marry you,” he answered, with retaliatory
scorn. “A white-faced vixen, when all’s said and
done! Mistress of Thornby Hall, after this night’s
business?—dod, I’m warned in time!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, say it again!” exclaimed Georgiana, rejoiced.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do say it again! Ecod, I know my value!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am freed of my promise!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay,” said Thornby, with a swelling wrath which
had to be discharged upon somebody, “and your
blundering uncle may go whistle.—You shall answer
for this, Foxwell, d’ye hear? I’ll see to that.
’Tis all along o’ your mismanagement. But I’ll be
quits wi’ ye. I’ll make use o’ that there letter!—rat
me but I will!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are quite unreasonable, Thornby,” said
Foxwell, patiently, and, turning to his attendant,
“Joseph, wait without.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Joseph left the room, whereupon Thornby had
the grace to order his own servant to be off; so
that the four principals were left alone. Foxwell
made sure that the door was closed against espial,
and thrust into the keyhole a part of the handkerchief
he had taken from Georgiana. He then
returned to Thornby, who had meanwhile been
fuming and pacing the floor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have cause for anger, I admit,” said Foxwell;
“but you are bound to own I have done my
part.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t talk to me, sir,” roared Thornby. “I’ll
make you smart afore I’ve done! See if I don’t!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell’s own temper gave way. He had been
put to much exercise of self-command this evening,
and had scarce yet regained his bodily composure
after his ride. Of a sudden, now, his face darkened.
“Then by heaven I’ll not smart alone! You shall
suffer, miss,—and your lover, too! Let all come
out. You say you know little of this young gentleman,
Thornby. Would you know more?—who
he is, <i>what</i> he is?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Uncle, you will not!” entreated Georgiana.
“With my promise I bought your silence—remember
that!—and I have not broken my promise.
’Tis Mr. Thornby has released me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well. Let us stick to promises, by all
means! But I have your Romeo upon other
grounds.—Before you as a justice of the peace,
Mr. Thornby, I charge this gentleman with the
abduction of my niece.—That, too, is a hanging
matter, miss.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not so, Mr. Thornby,” cried Georgiana; “for,
now that I am free, I go with this gentleman of my
own consent. ’Tis not abduction, ’tis on my part
a voluntary flight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You forget you are not yet your own mistress,”
said Foxwell. “Besides, the abduction has been
committed. Moreover, Thornby, the gentleman has
appropriated to himself a horse of mine. I demand
of you to act upon these charges.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thornby underwent a sudden accession of magisterial
dignity. “I know my office, Mr. Foxwell.
Nobody has ever accused me of failing there. Sir,”—this
to Everell,—“when the case is put to me
in that form, I must do as my commission requires.
I must needs hold you for a hearing.—I’ll send
for my clerk, Foxwell; I left him at the table, but
I dare say he’s still sober enough for what’s to be
done.” Relapsing then into his more usual puerility,
he added, “Dod, such impudent young strangers
sha’n’t carry off our ladies with impunity, neither!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Georgiana had hastened to Everell’s side. “Oh,
save yourself <i>now</i>,” she besought him in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not without you, sweet.—Gentlemen,” he
cried, in time to stop Thornby’s movement toward
the door, “one word. I am in a desperate position.
Abduction, horse-stealing, the other business,—any
one of them is the price of a halter. With but one
life to lose, then, what is a crime or two more? ’Tis
but getting the more value for my neck.” He took
up the pistols left on the table by Thornby, who
had lost all thought of them on being convinced of
Everell’s honesty. Dexterously cocking them as he
spoke, the young man went on: “If I must die, be
sure that one or both of you shall go before me—’tis
fair precedence, <i>cedant arma togæ</i>! But first
I will have one more venture for my life—and
for my love.” By this time, he had each of the
gentlemen in line with a different pistol. “Mr.
Thornby, move or call out, at your peril. Mr. Foxwell,
the same to you; and this also: I think I can
persuade you to withdraw your charges, and, furthermore,
to lend me the horses that brought you
and your man to this place.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell’s only weapon at the moment was his
sword; he had left his pistols outside in the holsters,
thinking to spend but a minute in Thornby Hall
and foreseeing no need of them there. He perceived
from Everell’s manner of handling the pistols
that the young man was of perfect assurance in
their use. The same circumstance found speedy
way to the mind of Thornby, who was unarmed.
So the two gentlemen stood as they were requested.
Foxwell, for want of a better temporizing answer,
feigned to yield with a good grace, saying: “You
present so strong an argument, that I know not
how to oppose you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I fear if the pistol were my only argument,”
said Everell, calmly, “my victory would end as soon
as my back was turned. I will try an argument
that may have more lasting effect. Miss Foxwell,
I must bid you pull out this drawer of the table,—stay
where you are, Mr. Thornby!—which the
owner has carelessly left open.” Everell moved a
step to the side, giving Georgiana closer access to
the drawer. She obeyed in wonder, for she had
overheard little of the talk while she was in the
closet, and nothing of Thornby’s allusion to that
in the drawer which gave the power of keeping Mr.
Robert Foxwell in his place. Everell now told her
to empty the contents of the drawer upon the table,
and to spread them out so that each document might
be seen. “Not a step, Mr. Thornby! You, Mr.
Foxwell, come near enough to see if there be anything
of interest to you. That will do—no farther!
Look carefully.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell’s keen eye had already begun to range
the various papers as they lay separately exposed.
Suddenly he uttered a quick “Ah!” and stepped
forward, reaching out. Everell checked him by a
sharp “Back!” and a movement of the pistol; then
followed with his glance the line of the extended
arm.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Miss Foxwell,” said Everell, “be good enough
to take up the paper your uncle reached for. ’Twill
be one of those three the shadow falls athwart,—the
shadow of the wine-bottle;—ay, those.—Don’t
move, Mr. Thornby.—Open them out,
Georgiana, and hold them where I can see. H’m;
apparently a legal document concerning one William
Hardy. The next, please: ‘a new cure for the
glanders.’ The other: a letter signed ‘R. Foxwell.’—Back,
Mr. Foxwell. Is that all you see here of
importance to you?—Mr. Thornby, if you take
a step toward the door—! Is that all, Mr. Foxwell?
I will not read it unless I am forced to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is all,” replied Foxwell, “and ’tis something
Mr. Thornby has no right to possess. I ask
you, as a man of honour, to restore it to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In proper time, sir. Meanwhile, Miss Foxwell,
fold the paper as it was, and place it in my waistcoat
pocket.—’Tis well done; though I dare not thank
you, for you do this under compulsion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the Lord, sir,” Thornby burst out at last,
“this here’s robbery, sir!—rank robbery under
arms! You may carry it off for the moment—I’m
not moving, I’m only warning you, for your
own good—but this sort of thing is bound to end
in a halter, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Possibly; but, as I have said, a crime or two
more can make no difference to a man in my situation.
You were kind enough to tell me that in
this drawer was the means of making Mr. Foxwell
consider your wishes. Let us see if it will make
him consider mine. Mr. Foxwell, whatever the
document contains, I’m not like to use it against
Georgiana’s kinsman. But if I am taken prisoner
here, ’twill no doubt fall into Mr. Thornby’s hands
again. Your interest, then, lies in my escape.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Damn Foxwell’s interest!” broke in Thornby.
“I’m the man to bargain with. If you restore that
letter and them pistols—’tis my property, that letter,
for all he says; mine, bought and paid for,
as I can prove by Jeremiah Filson—”</p>

<p class='c012'>This name, in relation to the letter, was another
surprise to Foxwell. But ere Thornby could proceed
farther, Everell commanded silence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are very good, Mr. Thornby, but I will
not bargain with you. I will forego the chaise
and horses, release you from your promise,—on
condition of your entering that closet. Come, I
mean it. You shall be let out in good time. ’Tis
no such bad place—the lady suffered no harm there.
Into the closet, if you please. I’ll return your pistols—by
and by.” Everell, while speaking, had
come around the end of the table, and was now
threatening Thornby with both pistols at close
quarters. “Into the closet, sir! By heaven, don’t
try my patience!—a man who may be hanged three
times over doesn’t balk at the chance of a fourth.
In, in!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Slowly retreating from the weapons as they were
thrust almost into his face, Thornby backed into
the closet, glaring futile wrath.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis well,” said Everell; “if you keep silence
there, I engage not to fire through the door.” Having
put one pistol in his coat pocket, he locked the
door and repocketed the key. He turned now to
Foxwell, who had been pondering. “I must borrow
your horses, sir, to the first posting-place. I
will send them back from there, with these pistols
and this key. You can then release this gentleman,
if he be not freed by other means before that;—he
will soon begin to make himself heard. I think
you will now see fit to speed my parting; for, look
you, if I am taken in my flight, Heaven knows
whose hands this letter may fall into.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And if you are not taken?” inquired Foxwell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will not read it, nor let anybody else read it;
and will send it to you from France as soon as I
am married to your niece. Regarding that matter,
I will only say now that I am a man of honour,
of good family, and some fortune.—I must still
carry you off, sweet. ’Tis the one safe course,
despite the dangers and discomforts you must
share.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Better the dangers and discomforts with you,
than the anxieties if I were left behind,” said Georgiana.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, Mr. Foxwell, may I beg you to conduct
us to the horses?—your servant might dispute
our taking them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell had now put the second pistol into the
opposite coat pocket, believing that the letter gave
him sufficient control over Foxwell’s actions. But
he kept his hand upon his sword-hilt, intending
that Foxwell should walk in front of him to the
horses.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A moment, pray,” said Foxwell. “Consider
the legal position I shall be left in if I assist you.
It does not suit me to fly the country, as it does
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who will trouble you on that score? Certainly
this booby justice will not desire to publish a matter
in which he makes so poor a figure. He knows not
who I am. In what crime can he then accuse you
of aiding me? The abduction and the horse-stealing
you need not pursue—you have signed no
charge, sworn to none.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The theft of the letter,” said Foxwell. “If I
help you to escape, I shall be accessory to that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you say he has no right to its possession.
In any case, you can show him how ridiculous he
will appear. I think you run little risk; but be that
as it may, I must think of my own risk. Every
moment adds to it; and to the danger of this letter
coming to wrong hands. So, if you please, to the
horses.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A curious look was on Foxwell’s face. It was
true that any struggle with Everell in the presence
of Thornby or his people might result in the letter’s
falling again into that gentleman’s hands. But there
was now no such person to interfere. A quick
sword-thrust—which could be justified as against
an escaping rebel—might win the letter in a moment;
Foxwell could destroy it immediately at the
fire, and make his peace with Thornby by releasing
him and showing his outrage avenged. No danger,
then, of the letter’s capture in the long journey of
a fugitive, or of Thornby’s attempting retaliation
by course of law. It was all seen in an instant.
Foxwell’s sword flashed in the air, and Everell had
to spring aside to save himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, treacherous!” cried the young man, as his
own blade leaped out.</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell’s second thrust came with surprising
swiftness, but was fairly met; and the two swords
darted and clashed again and again. Georgiana,
with every impulse to rush between the fighters,
dared not do so, and was indeed compelled to move
rapidly to keep out of their way, watching them
with fear and horror. While the noise of their quick
feet, their loud breathing and sharp ejaculations,
and the clashing steel filled the apartment, there
came from some other part of the house a sound
of half-drunken singing. This was unheeded, even
when it was evidently approaching. Foxwell, perceiving
that he had counted too much upon the
suddenness and sureness of his attack, and feeling
that he was entitled to little mercy if he lost, fought
with the impetuosity of desperation. His arm at
length grew heavy; and Everell, who on his side
used a concentration of faculties worthy of the issue
at stake, found opening for a lunge that pinked the
other’s forearm, causing him to lower his hand
with a cry of chagrin. The next instant the young
man struck the weapon from Foxwell’s weakened
grasp, sending it flying to the door; which at that
moment opened, letting in two men who walked arm
in arm and bawled a bacchanalian song.</p>

<p class='c012'>From their dress and appearance, it was evident
that these newcomers were Mr. Thornby’s table
companions, doubtless come in search of him. One
of them, a short, heavy-set person with a wig awry,
was plainly very drunk indeed. The other, a slim,
prudent-looking fellow, seemed in good command
of his senses. This man, having nearly tripped over
the sword, picked it up, and looked with astonishment
at those in the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eh!” he exclaimed. “My Jacobite, by all
that’s holy! Here’s providential work! Call your
men, Mr. Potkin.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The stout little man pulled himself together,
blinked at Everell, and then bolted from the room.
“The justice’s clerk, gone to bring varlets of the
law,” thought Everell, who stood regaining his
breath. Foxwell withdrew panting to the other side
of the table, dropped into Thornby’s chair, and
began pulling up his sleeve to examine his wound.
Filson put himself on guard with the sword before
the doorway, with the manifest intention of disputing
Everell’s escape from the room till help
should come. Perhaps the courage of wine, the
excitement of beholding his quarry at last, or the
sight of Everell’s winded condition, emboldened the
man: at any rate, he showed resolution, and his
manner with the sword was that of some practice
in fencing—not a surprising thing at a time when
gentlemen’s gentlemen imitated the accomplishments
of their masters.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What! you menace me!” cried Everell; “then
be careful of your other ear, hound!” With this
he rushed upon Filson, thrusting along the side of
the latter’s head, and running the point through the
wig, though not touching the ear.</p>

<p class='c012'>Filson turned pale, but made a pass, which was
narrowly avoided. Everell gave a second lunge,
and this time the weapon pierced the somewhat
extended auricular shell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Help! help, Mr. Foxwell!” shouted Filson,
clapping one hand to the injured ear, but still wielding
his sword against Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Call for help to those who buy letters from
you, cur,” replied Foxwell, scarce looking up from
his task of binding his arm with a handkerchief,
a business performed by his left hand with the aid
of his teeth. Georgiana had looked an offer of
assistance, which her uncle had repelled. Her attention
instantly returned to her lover.</p>

<p class='c012'>On hearing Foxwell’s answer, Filson shrank
back; but Everell pressed him close, parried a desperate
lunge, and sent a swift long thrust for the
region of the heart. Filson dropped like a log, and
lay as still as one, a result somewhat unexpected
by Everell, to whom the resistance had seemed only
that of the man’s loose coat.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come!” cried Everell, and, while Georgiana
hastened to his side, he added to her uncle: “All
that I said awhile ago still holds true. I wish you
good night.” He then led Georgiana around the
prostrate body of Filson, and through the doorway.
Just outside in the hallway stood Joseph and the
footman, who had been attracted by the noise to
peer into the room, which as yet they dared not re-enter.
Everell waved them aside with his sword,
and the lovers quickly passed. The two men, not
knowing what to do, again looked into the room,
Joseph expectant of his master’s orders, and
the footman wondering at the disappearance of
Thornby. Nobody else was in the hall, and Everell
and Georgiana were in a moment at the door opposite
that by which they had entered the house. It
was not fastened. Throwing it open, Everell found
that he was right in what, from his present knowledge
of the roads and gates, he had assumed,—namely,
that Foxwell’s horses were waiting at this
entrance. They were in charge of a boy who evidently
belonged to Thornby Hall, perhaps to the
gate-lodge. On the door-step was a lantern.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell sheathed his sword, and said, quietly, to
the boy: “We are to use Mr. Foxwell’s horses,
my good lad.” He coolly helped Georgiana into the
saddle, mounted the other horse, and bade the boy
hand him the lantern. The lad, ignorant of Foxwell’s
purposes and of the fighting in the house,
and obedient by habit, complied. “Now run before,
and you shall receive a crown at the gate,”
said Everell, grasping Georgiana’s rein and his
own. He was at the same time wondering to what
part of the house or vicinity the clerk had gone for
his forces. He trusted that Foxwell would now see
his interest in passively aiding the flight, and would
find means to keep Joseph and Thornby’s servant
from interfering or giving alarm.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this he was not deceived. Foxwell saw all
chance gone of obtaining the letter by force of his
own; and now feared that, if taken by Thornby’s
men, Everell would rather entrust it to them than
suffer Foxwell to possess it after what had occurred.</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxwell, therefore, upon noticing the two servants
at the doorway, called Joseph to assist in binding
his wound. He then assigned the footman to
the impossible task of prizing open the door of
Thornby’s prison with a poker. This apparent concern
for Thornby’s comfort was partly for the
future conciliation of that gentleman; and Foxwell
intended to employ his wound to the same end, on
the ground that he had received it in the Squire’s
interest. As he sat thinking the matter out, and
watching Joseph’s bungling attempts to fasten a
bandage, Foxwell heard a loud tramping, as of several
heavy feet, in the hall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The men whom the clerk went to fetch,”
thought he; and, without turning his head, considered
how he might delay them with perfect safety
to himself. But, just as they seemed about to enter
the room, there was a brief pause in their movements;
and then they were heard rushing away and
out of the hall. It was as if they had learned at
the very threshold that the person they sought was
gone elsewhere. Foxwell turned his eyes upon the
doorway, near which Filson had fallen. To his
amazement, the body of that rascal was not to be
seen. This enabled Foxwell to account for the
movements of the justice’s men: the knave had yet
life enough to crawl out and indicate the way the
fugitive had taken. The trampling of the men in
the hall, the footman’s noise with the poker, and
certain incoherent words of inquiry and command
which Thornby had begun to shout from his closet,
had covered the sound of Filson’s exit.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, Everell and Georgiana had ridden
down a driveway of considerable length, following
close upon the heels of the boy, whom the lantern
enabled them to keep in sight. The gate had swung
to after Foxwell’s entrance. As the lad went to
open it, and Everell put his hand in his pocket for
the promised crown, there came a noise of men
issuing from the house they had left, followed by
a cry: “Stop them! gate, ho! let nobody pass!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The boy gave a startled look at the riders, and
stood hesitating. Everell, who had been holding the
lantern high so as to see the way, quickly handed
it to Georgiana; drew one of the pistols from his
pocket, pointed it at the lad’s head, and, at the same
time offering the crown piece with his left hand,
said: “Lead or silver, which?”</p>

<div id='i333'  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i333.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“THE HORSES DASHED FORWARD.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The boy, whose mind had probably never worked
so rapidly in his life before, flung the gate open.
Men were now heard running toward them from
the top of the driveway. Everell threw the coin at
the boy, and the horses dashed forward. Once in
the road, the lovers turned to the right, thus aiming
for the town wherein they had first met. Everell
put away the pistol, but allowed Georgiana, at her
own suggestion, to retain possession of the lantern,
that he might be the readier with his weapons,
should occasion arise. Of this there was not much
immediate likelihood, for, now that the gate was
passed, Thornby’s men must needs resort to horses
if they meant to give chase.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you ride well, sweet?” Everell called to
Georgiana, as they galloped along the road.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well enough,” she replied, as cheerily as she
could.</p>

<p class='c012'>He now observed, for the first time, that she was
riding man-fashion; his cloak, which she still wore,
enabling her to do so with less loss in appearance
than addition of safety.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will not soon forget the night of your
abduction,” said he, gaily.</p>

<p class='c012'>She reminded him it was no longer an abduction,
but a flight on her part as well as his. And both
of them, though they said nothing, wondered what
would be the end of it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>HORSES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>After</span> a mile or so, the riders slackened speed,
and kept an easy pace thereafter till they were near
the town. Two or three times they had made a
momentary halt to listen, but had heard nothing to
indicate that they were followed. Everell had frequently
asked Georgiana how she did, and she had
declared, “Very well.” He now inquired whether
she could travel much farther without stopping to
rest, and begged her to be perfectly honest in her
reply. She assured him she was equal to a dozen
miles, at least.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then it is a question,” said he, “whether we
should stay a few hours at the place we are coming
to, or go on to the next town southward. I conceive
we have naught to fear from your uncle. As
for Thornby, I know not. He may desire that
nothing of all this shall become known; on the
other hand, his wrath may outweigh his vanity.
’Tis not likely his men would give chase so far
without his commands. The clerk would certainly
go to consult him before ordering a long pursuit,
and Thornby’s first care would be to get himself
liberated from the closet. No doubt all depends
on his state of feeling at that moment. Were
Jeremiah Filson still a factor in the case, I should
count on pursuit. Men of that persistent sort, having
once set themselves a task, are not to be thrown
off, however slight be the gain or the motive. They
know how to make such as Thornby the servants
of their wills. But without Filson’s egging on, I
doubt if Thornby or his clerk will give themselves
much trouble concerning us. Your uncle, I think,
will find means to dissuade them. In any case, we
have a fair start, so that if you feel the least fatigue
or discomfort, sweet,—And yet, ’twould go hard
to lose all, after coming off so well hitherto. Certainly
Thornby will be in a great fury:—to be
locked in his own closet, after being robbed of
you and of his power over your uncle! At first
he will be for revenge at any cost. And who knows
but he may linger in that mind? He may make it
a great matter, inform the sheriff of the county,
and raise a general hue and cry. ’Tis a possibility
we must reckon with. Our only security against
it is a long start at the outset. And yet you’ve
already undergone too much to-night. Perhaps two
or three hours of rest—But, devil take it, Filson
has been at this town!—’twas here you warned me
of him. No doubt he has left accounts of me. I
may be recognized if I show my face at any house.
But, if we pass through the town in this darkness—”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was going on to consider the alternatives
further, but Georgiana, having waited in vain for
a pause, now interrupted with the most positive
assertion that she would not think of stopping at
the town they were about to enter. So they walked
their horses through such of its narrow streets as
lay in their route, and were soon upon the open
road again, having encountered no light nor other
sign of life. They improved their speed, and, having
passed the spot where Everell had taken leave
of Roughwood a fortnight before,—though its
location could not be certified in the darkness,—arrived
at another town of silent streets wherein
no lamp or candle relieved the night. By their
own lantern, the lovers were enabled to inspect the
house-fronts, and to select what appeared to be the
chief inn of the place. After much imperative calling
for the landlord, Everell was answered by a
half-dressed man, of whom he demanded accommodations
in the tone of authority that had imposed
upon the servants at Thornby Hall. Here, as there,
it availed, and, as soon as the travellers were admitted,
Everell curtly explained that the lady had
met with an accident; he added, carelessly, that
they had come from the South.</p>

<p class='c012'>The half-dressed man proving to be the landlord,
Everell bespoke a chaise and fresh horses for an
early hour in the morning; and, as there was only
one sleeping-room available, saw Georgiana conducted
thereto; after which he made his own bed,
with the aid of his cloak, on a settle in the bar-parlour.
He passed the night in a half-sleep, ready
to take alarm at any sound of later arrivals. In
the morning, when the time set for departure was
near, he summoned a maid and was about to send
her to Georgiana, when that lady herself appeared
on the stairs. She was quite ready to travel, having
interviewed the innkeeper’s wife, and acquired
a hat, a mantle, and some other articles, all in a
fair state of preservation, in exchange for one of
her rings.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell complimented her upon this timely regard
for appearances while travelling by daylight, and
declared that no other woman in England could
look as well in the costliest finery as Georgiana did
in the second-hand wardrobe of a country landlady.
Georgiana was pleased at this; but not entirely so,
until he added that she should supply herself in
better accordance with her own taste at the first
opportunity. He then handed her into the chaise,
entrusted to the landlord the despatching of the
horses and pistols to Foxwell, and gave directions
to the postilion. Hearing these, the innkeeper was
much puzzled, for Everell had designedly given him
the impression that the journey of the couple was
Northward. Ere he could scratch a probable solution
of the problem into his head, the chaise was
rattling away.</p>

<p class='c012'>The freshness of the morning had its effect upon
the lovers at first; but Everell soon perceived that
Georgiana was pale and languid. He urged her to
try to sleep, and offered his shoulder as a pillow.
She, on her side, observed that his voice was quite
hoarse, and insisted upon arranging his cloak so
that he, too, could rest. Presently, in spite of herself,
her eyes closed. He pillowed her head as he
had suggested, and softly kissed her hair. The
next fact of which he was distinctly conscious was
that the chaise had stopped before a roadside inn,
and the postilion was telling him that here was a
good place at which to breakfast. Glad to find, on
inquiry, how many hours and miles they had got
rid of in sleep, Everell awakened Georgiana, and
they were regaled with bread, cheese, and fried
bacon. They were now quite cured of fatigue,
though Everell’s hoarseness was increased.</p>

<p class='c012'>The journey was resumed. A few towns and many
villages were left behind. Finally, at the end of a
stage, Everell thought the time of changing horses
might safely be utilized in visiting some shops near
the posting-inn. When the travellers returned with
their purchases, their new conveyance was ready.
They set out immediately, putting off dinner to the
late afternoon rather than make a longer stop at
present. As they drove out of the yard into the
street, Georgiana uttered a quick “Oh!” and drew
back from the chaise window, at the same time laying
her hand on Everell’s breast to make him do
likewise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The man on horseback,” she replied; “don’t
look out! ’Tis Jeremiah Filson!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Impossible! I left him as good as dead. You
are mistaken, sweet. How could you know him?—you
have scarcely seen him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I saw him well enough at Thornby Hall last
night; and this I am certain was he. He was riding
up the street; there was another horseman with
him. He looked tired, and the horses seemed
fagged. ’Twas he, I could swear,—the same
clothes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then the dog must have feigned, last night,
to save himself from a <i>coup de grace</i>. Did he see
us, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He didn’t appear to. He was looking at the
houses, I thought.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Looking for the inn, probably. Well, if he
stops there, he will inquire for us. If not, he is
close behind us. In either case, he is on our track.
Thank heaven, we are almost out of the town.”—The
new postilion, as soon as the chaise was safe
in the street, had whipped up his horses to a gallop,
in order to make the showy start affected by artists
in his craft.—“Filson’s experience last night has
given him a respect for my sword,” Everell went
on; “he will not dare come within reach of it
himself. I at least pinked his other ear, as I promised
to. He will now act with caution; will attempt
to hunt me down without showing himself, and, if
he finds me tarrying anywhere, will apply to the
local authorities. He will be no less dangerous for
proceeding in that way—he will be the more so,
rather. We shall not dare stop long anywhere. We
had best take our meals at solitary country inns,
where he cannot come up unperceived, nor set the
authorities upon me without time and trouble. We
must travel night and day till we are safe: to sleep
at an inn would give him his opportunity. I see
’tis possible for you to sleep as we go. So then,
barring accident, we shall doubtless keep our lead
to the end, if he hangs on so far.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if we are delayed at the posting-houses?”
said Georgiana. “Sometimes one cannot get horses
immediately.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, there is one danger,” Everell replied. “But
we must gain such a distance that we may lose time
and yet be away before he can steal upon us; or
at least before he can bring officers about us. We
must not tarry long in a garrison town. Military
officers would be too ready to act upon information
in such a case as mine. He cannot get the civil
powers to move so quickly. Well, we must keep
our lead. In the country he will not venture too
close upon our heels. We are out of the town, at
last. I wonder if he stopped at that inn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell thrust his head out of the side window
and looked back. Nobody was following. He then
called to the driver, and gave instructions in regard
to the pace of travel, hinting at the reward in store
for obedience. The lad was so compliant, the horses
so fresh, that in due time Everell thought a pause
might be made for dinner without much risk of
their being overtaken. At the next suitable house
of refreshment he ordered a halt, somewhat to the
disapproval of the postilion, who would have preferred
to stop at an inn of his own suggesting.
Everell chose this, however, because it had as neighbours
only two or three brick houses and a half-dozen
thatched cottages, all looking drowsy behind
ragged hedges, while its chief window commanded
a view of the road over which the fugitives had
come.</p>

<p class='c012'>They caused a table to be placed at the window,
and there, on a soiled cloth, were served with boiled
eggs, cold bacon, and bread, by the frowsy woman
who had taken the order, set the table, and done
the cooking. But the eggs were fresh, and the
bacon good, so that little was left on the table when
the travellers rose from it. The postilion had
evidently found the ale, bread, and cheese better
than he had expected; and the horses apparently
had nothing to complain of in their refreshment. At
all events, the journey was resumed in good spirits,
and, as no sign of Filson had appeared upon the
stretch of road in sight, the lovers began to feel
more secure. Georgiana now recalled Filson’s jaded
appearance. Perhaps, as on a former occasion, he
had yielded to the dictates of tired nature: perhaps
he had thrown over the pursuit, and was merely
bound for London. As for the horseman with him,
that might have been a postboy or a casual fellow
traveller. While their own chaise went rolling
along at good speed, the lovers felt hope increase
within them. Nevertheless, they were still determined
to go on by night.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dusk had risen—or, rather, fallen, to be
accurate in spite of the poets—when they arrived
at the place where they would have to obtain the
horses and vehicle for their night journey. It was
a small town, with a High Street enlivened by the
humbler inhabitants strolling up and down in the
light from the shop windows. A lamp hung over
the entrance to the principal inn. As soon as the
chaise was in the yard, Everell called for a fresh
conveyance.</p>

<p class='c012'>The landlord was very sorry, but there were no
horses. How soon would there be any? Certainly
not that night: he wouldn’t send out tired cattle,
not for love or money. Would there be a stage-coach,
or even a carrier’s wagon? Not before
morning. Everell turned to the postilion, who was
now busy with his own fagged horses. No, sir;
this was as far as he dared go: he knew his orders;
his cattle were done for, and <i>he</i> was done for, and
he wouldn’t let his beasts go another mile, not for
love or money or the King himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mind how you speak of the King, booby,” a
voice broke in, pertly; and Everell, looking around,
saw three or four trim young fellows at the taproom
door, all in red coats.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Soldiers in town?” said Everell to the landlord.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, your Honour; two companies waiting
orders. You’d ’a’ had the pleasure of meeting the
officers at dinner if you’d come a little sooner, but
now they be all gone to a ball at a gentleman’s house
in the neighbourhood. Most of them lodge here;
but I have a very good room left, at your Honour’s
service.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t want a room. I want horses. Where
can I get them? Is there no other place in the
town?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The landlord shook his head sadly; but one of
the soldiers said: “There’s a house across the way,
sir,—the Red Swan. I’m not sure you can get
horses there, but ’tis there or nowhere if this house
can’t supply them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell thanked the man, pressed a shilling into
his hand, settled with his own postilion, and had
his luggage carried before himself and Georgiana
to the Red Swan. This was a smaller house than
the one they had left. It had no driveway through
the middle; the entrance to the yard was by a side
lane. The travellers, entering by the front door,
found a corridor leading to the bar—and to the
landlady. Could one hire horses and some sort of
light vehicle? Yes, to be sure; but not that night:
all the horses and carriages in the town were taking
people to the ball a few miles out. Everell looked
blankly at Georgiana. The landlady could offer his
Honour the best rooms in the house. On the morrow
there would be horses a-plenty. They would be
returning from the ball by midnight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, then, if we wait till midnight, we may have
the first horses that come in?” said Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>The landlady was not sure. She would have to
ask John, who was now driving to the ball. When
he returned with his horses, he might be willing;
the cattle would be fresh enough, but John might
not be. At this, Everell spoke so eloquently, despite
his hoarseness, of rewards and of his confidence in
the landlady’s ability to influence John if she would,
and Georgiana supported him with such sweetly
anxious looks, that the good woman thought she
could almost certainly promise a conveyance and
John’s attendance at midnight or thereabouts. As
for the intervening time, it was decided that Georgiana
should lie down dressed, while Everell should
remain on the alert. He saw her to the door of
a room at the head of the stairs, and returned to
caution the landlady against acknowledging their
presence to possible inquirers. He relied on the
woman’s good-will and evident belief that they were
an eloping pair fearful only of parental discovery.
He then went by a rear door to stretch his legs in
the inn yard, which he thought to find deserted.</p>

<p class='c012'>The yard was for the most part in darkness, its
only light being that of a lantern hung against the
gate-post. To Everell’s surprise, a pair of horses
attached to a post-chaise were feeding under the
care of a small boy. Everell was promptly inquisitive,
but the undersized hostler had no gift of
communication, and could say no more than that
the chaise had arrived awhile ago and would be
going on pretty soon. Everell returned to the landlady.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, ay,” she said, in reply to his remark about
the horses. “They belong to a gentleman with a
toothache, who stops only long enough for supper.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You didn’t mention him before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, sir, from his coming to this house instead
of t’other, and from his ordering a private room to
sup in, I took it he’d rather nothing was said of his
being here. But, come to think of it, he might want
to keep out of sight because of his face being
swollen up—’tis all tied round with a yankerchief.
Yet that wouldn’t account for his having
his postilion eat in the same room with him, would
it, sir? It looks as how he was afeard the man
would say too much if let eat in the kitching. Well,
I hope as I’ve done him no harm by what I’ve told
your Honour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not in the least. I wish I had his horses. I
would even accept his toothache, if I could have
the horses with it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He entered the small public parlour, and dropped
into a chair at the head of the long table. He had
the room to himself, and could flee to the darkness
of the yard if anybody intruded. Leaning forward
with his elbows on the table, he lapsed into a drowsy
state which seemed, in the circumstances, the state
best calculated to cheat the time. He had remained
therein for more than half an hour, when his ears,
on the alert, informed him of a soft step outside
the room. He rose, and beheld Georgiana in the
half-open doorway. Finger on lip, she approached
and whispered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have seen him. I think he knows we are
here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who?” asked Everell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Filson. I happened to look out of my window—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Impossible! He couldn’t have followed so
close.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He must have gained upon us toward nightfall,
and arrived at the inn across the way a little while
ago. I happened to glance out of my window just
now—not putting my head out, but looking
through the glass—and I saw four men standing
under the lamp before that inn—the lamp over the
entrance. Three of them were the soldiers we saw
in the yard. The other was Filson. He was talking
with the soldiers, and he and they were looking at
this house. I am sure they were telling him we
had come here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did they see you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think not. They weren’t looking at my window
when I first saw them, and after that I watched
from behind the curtain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, then, he knows we are here. The fellow
who carried our luggage across would have told
the soldiers we failed to get horses. I should have
taken some pains to cover our track. We are too
easily described. I might have known Filson would
inquire before even entering the inn; his fear of
coming suddenly within reach of my sword would
make him do that. Well, the evil is done. What
steps will the fellow take?—that is the question.
Fortunately, those soldiers can do nothing without
orders, and their officers have gone to the ball.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But hear me through,” said Georgiana. “After
they had talked a minute or so, Filson and one of
the soldiers walked up the street, so fast that I soon
lost sight of them. The other two soldiers remained—to
watch this house, perhaps. And then
I came to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“H’m! Without doubt Filson has gone in quest
of somebody in authority. We must be gone from
this house, at all events. Filson may return—who
knows how soon?—may return with a gang of
constables or a file of soldiers. Come, we must
leave this inn, at least.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But those two are watching: they will see us
go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll go through the yard. It opens to a lane,
which may have two entrances—else we must find
some back way, or scale a wall, if need be. Come;
I’ll see the landlady as we go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, heaven! In the passage—footsteps—of
men!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell listened a moment, his hand on his sword-hilt.
“Nay, ’tis all well. Two men walking from
the stairs to the yard: they are a guest and his
postilion. ’Tis a gentleman with a toothache. The
landlady has been telling me of him. I would to
heaven—Ah, perhaps—Come, sweet! come!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Seizing her hand, Everell led her swiftly from
the room, along the passage, and through a back
door, to the yard.</p>

<p class='c012'>The forms of the strange gentleman, the postilion,
and the small hostler were dimly visible at the
darker side of the chaise. The postilion was evidently
about to light his lamps. Everell left Georgiana
standing in a shadowed corner by the house
door, and advanced to the other gentleman, keeping
as much in the darkness as he. The stranger’s
head presented a very bulky appearance, thanks not
only to the handkerchief encircling it, but also to
its being thickly muffled up to the mouth. His hat,
moreover, was drawn down to his eyes. So, indeed,
was Everell’s.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir,” began Everell, inwardly cursing the
hoarseness that prevented a more ingratiating tone,
“pardon the intrusion of one who means no offence.
’Tis a matter of life and death that moves me, a
stranger, to address you as I do. There is also a
lady whose fortunes are at stake. ’Tis of the first
importance that we leave this place immediately.
We have not been able to obtain horses. Seeing you
about to depart alone, I am impelled to throw myself
on your generosity. Will you take us as passengers,
to the next town, at least? If you will take
the lady in the chaise, I can sit on the bar in front.
The postilion shall be well rewarded.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, sir,” replied the other, in a thick voice,
the more indistinct from his much muffled condition,
“if you are travelling in my direction—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Southward,” said Everell, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am sorry, then, for I am going North.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“North? What ill fortune! For an instant I
thought myself happy. North!—but surely, sir,
your necessity for going on at once is not as great
as ours: it cannot be. If you knew the case—the
lady is waiting yonder in the darkness, trembling
with anxiety as to our fate. Our whole future, sir,
hangs upon the next few minutes. Dare I ask you—nay,
dare I refrain from asking you—to resign
this conveyance to us? There will be another
available at midnight. Your business certainly is
not so urgent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My business, sir, is as urgent as any can be. It
has the first claim on me, much as I would fain
serve you. I dare not lose an hour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, good heaven, sir, have I not told you my
affair is one of life or death?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so is mine,” said the strange gentleman,
stepping back to be out of range of the chaise-lamp,
which the postilion had now lighted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everell followed into the darker gloom, pleading
desperately: “But consider, sir, my case concerns
the happiness of a woman.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mine concerns the safety of a man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good God!” exclaimed Everell, maddened at
the other’s phlegmatic brevity of speech. “To see
these horses ready for the road, to need them as
I do, to know how she must suffer if I—Sir, I
entreat you: I must have these horses: I demand
them in the sacred name of love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I require them in the sacred interest of friendship,”
was the answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Friendship!” laughed Everell, scornfully.
“The love of man and woman—do you know what
that is?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“None knows better; but at present I serve the
friendship of man for man. One task at a time.
Were I not entered upon this, I would do much to
oblige you. I can only wish you better fortune than
you expect; and—good night.” With that the
stranger went toward the chaise, all being now
ready for departure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not yet good night, either!” cried Everell,
stepping into the other’s way. “’Tis a rude thing
I do, but necessity compels me. If your mission
is all to you, mine is all to me. Let our swords
decide for us—I see you wear one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wear one,” said the gentleman, patiently,
“but I had rather not draw it now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You had rather be commanded, then,” said Everell,
drawing his own. “You have a toothache,
I hear. A gentleman with a toothache ought not to
travel at night. For your own good, I must forbid
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you have a bad cold, as your voice betrays.
A gentleman with a bad cold ought still less to
travel at night.” And the stranger now calmly
drew. “Make way, sir, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Stand back, sir,” replied Everell, “till I call the
lady to enter the chaise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The stranger’s retort to this was a sword-thrust
at Everell’s groin. Though the men were in too
great darkness to distinguish faces, a certain sense
he had acquired by much training enabled Everell
to parry this attack. When he returned the thrust,
his adversary showed an equal instinct for judging
the movements of a barely visible weapon. Several
passes were exchanged, to the great affright of
Georgiana, who could only make out the moving
forms in the gloom and hear the clashing of the
steel. She had the presence of mind to close the
house door, lest the sound might bring other spectators.
As for the postilion and the boy, they stood
astonished at a safe distance, not daring to raise an
alarm for fear of incurring the vengeance of the
combatants. The fight was hot and equally maintained.
Unexpectedly Everell struck his left hand
against the chaise door. For greater safety of
movement, he stepped back a few paces, and so
came, without thought, into the lamplight.</p>

<p class='c012'>The other gentleman, in the act of following,
uttered a cry of surprise, and held his sword motionless.
The voice was quite different from that
he had previously used.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eh!—who are you?” exclaimed Everell, lowering
his own weapon.</p>

<p class='c012'>The stranger advanced into the light, pulling
down his muffler.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Roughwood!” cried Everell, springing forward
to embrace the man he had just been trying to
wound.</p>

<p class='c012'>“H’sh!” warned the other, cautious as ever.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good heaven!—if we had killed each other!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We should have been served right for not knowing
each other. But till this moment I didn’t rightly
see you. Your husky voice deceived me: I should
never have thought it your voice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis the best voice I can muster at present. But
<i>you</i> seem to have two voices.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The other was put on—like the muffler, handkerchief,
and toothache. I was recognized on my
way South after leaving you; and now, coming
back through the same country—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why coming back? I supposed you safe in
France.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I saw her whom I wished to see; but I could
not persuade myself to sail without you, or knowledge
of you. As days passed and you arrived not—In
short, I feared your rash resolve had got you into
trouble—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you were coming to my aid! Dear Roughwood!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But we lose time. You spoke of a lady.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will recognize her,” said Everell, and hastened
to conduct Georgiana into the light. Leaving
her and Roughwood to mutual surprise and explanation,
he returned to the bar of the inn, and, having
overcome the landlady’s refusal of payment, possessed
himself of his and Georgiana’s luggage.
When he reappeared in the yard, his friend had
already handed the young lady into the chaise, and
was giving directions to the postilion. Everell was
for Roughwood’s taking the place beside Georgiana,
but that gentleman cut short all dispute by mounting
the bar in front and allowing Everell ten seconds
in which to enter the chaise. Before less time had
passed, Everell was seated at his Georgiana’s side,
her hand was stealing into his, the hostler had closed
the door of the chaise, and the postilion had given
the word of starting. He drove carefully out
through the gate with the solitary lamp, slowly on
through the lane to the street, and then for the
open road southward, the horses getting up speed at
the crack of the whip.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so, Jeremiah Filson,” said Everell, as the
lights of the houses ceased and the night lay blue
and misty over the fields, “we have left you behind
once more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thanks to the careful arrangements of Roughwood,
no time was lost on the rest of the journey,
day or night, and the lovers never saw Jeremiah
Filson again. A man answering to his description
arrived a day late at the fishing village from which
they had set sail; and lingered for a week or more,
questioning the inhabitants, and often, from the
highest cliffs, gazing far out to sea with a puzzled
expression. This they learned from Roughwood’s
future wife, when she and her brother came to them
in Paris.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Prudence, for whom Georgiana sent as
soon as she conveniently could, the lovers—for
lovers they remained after marriage and through
life—heard the latest news of Foxwell Court and
Thornby Hall. Mr. Foxwell had come to a better
understanding with his neighbour Thornby, so that
the pair now frequently got drunk together at one
or the other’s table; they spent considerable time
at cards, with results apparently to Foxwell’s satisfaction;
and it was settled that he should lend the
distinction of his presence to the Squire’s approaching
nuptials. For the Squire, as if to show the
depth of disappointed love by an urgent need of
consolation, had suddenly—and successfully—resolved
to marry Sukey Marvell.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
